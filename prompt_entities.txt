This text is a letter to the editor as printed in a 1930s newspaper. Return the results as a JSON object, with this field: 'entities', which contains 'name', 'type' and 'identity' subfields. The 'name' field contains the name as it was found in the source document. A valid name must contain at least one capitalized word.

Follow these rules for entities:

1. The entities field must contain an array of all of the names (real or hypothetical) mentioned in the text. Types of names include person, place, organization, office, and any others you need. It is very important not to miss any names, so if you are not sure, assume that you have found a name. Be sure to include all place names: a city, a state, a country, etc. 

2. Format each name as a json object, with values for the text of the name, the type of name, and the identity. The identity contains any information you can provide about the likely identification of the name, given the historical context of the text. 

3. Include the place name "Cleveland" if the letter evidently deals with local affairs, and include "Ohio" if deals with state affairs. 

4. Do not invent or hallucinate any information. If you cannot identify a name, leave the identification empty.
