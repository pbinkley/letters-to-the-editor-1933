Perform optical character recognition on the provided image from a newspaper section containing letters to the editor. 

1. It is extremely import that you never invent or hallucinate any text that does not exist in the image. I will strangle everyone you love if you do that.

2. The source text is in paragraphs, which are introduced with a small indentation. Merge all the lines of a paragraph into a single line. Remove end-of-line hyphens that break words. Insert a blank line between paragraphs.

3. Titles are in all capitals. Make sure there is a blank line before and after each title.

4. If lines are right-justified, keep them as separate lines.

5. Never invent or generate new text: return only the text from the image.

6. If the text appears to end with an incomplete paragraph, place "+++" at the end of the text. Otherwise, end the text with a blank line.

7. Titles are paragraphs in all capital letters. There must always be an empty line before and after a title.

8. Some lines are badly damaged in the picture and cannot be read. Replace these lines with a row of x's.
