Process the provided image of a newspaper section containing letters to the editor. First, assemble the continuous text in order, following these rules:

1. The first headline is to be included in the text. This headline extends across all three text columns.

2. Under the headline are three columns of text, with a maximum width of approximately 36 characters or 1/3 of the image width, separated by thin black vertical lines. It is very important to divide the image into three columns before further processing.

3. If lines are right-justified, keep them as separate lines.

4. Read the columns of text from left to right, and within each column, from top to bottom, and add their content to a variable we will call FullText. It is important to respect the layout: read the columns in order, and read each complete column before starting on the next column. It is very important never to allow text from different columns to be mixed.

Show me the FullText.
