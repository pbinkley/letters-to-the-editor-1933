Process the provided image of a newspaper section containing letters to the editor. First, assemble the continuous text in order, following these rules:

1. The top headline is to be included in the text. This headline extends across all three text columns. Do not include a blank line between the top headline text and the text that follows.

2. Under the top headline are three columns of text, with a maximum width of approximately 36 characters or 1/3 of the image width, separated by thin black vertical lines. It is crucial to divide the image into three columns before further processing. Under no circumstances should you read a line of text across two columns.

3. Process columns from left to right

4. Clearly separate content from different columns

5. The source text is in paragraphs, which are introduced with a small indentation. Merge all the lines of a paragraph into a single line. Remove end-of-line hyphens that break words. 

6. Make sure there is a blank line before each title.

7. If lines are right-justified, keep them as separate lines.
