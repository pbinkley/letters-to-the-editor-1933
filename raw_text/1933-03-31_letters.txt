To the Editor of The Press:
Questions are in order regarding the recent censor of our new burlesque houses.

Why is it that a few sob sisters who find enjoyment in a funeral parlor govern the pleasures of the majority. I have attended a few of the shows and from my experience I can say that I did not see any traps or nets around the entrance to ensare any unsuspecting hypocrites. Look back a few years to 1918. We had the same thing thÃªn and the outcome was that long-nosed individual who spells his name with a capital "P." Why don't these so-called upholders of righteousness stay at home and put black glasses on their tom cats? They would do the community at large a greater benefit.

HARRY L. DAVIS,
OUR OWN PERSHING

To the Editor of The Press
If a foreign country would declare war, on the United States who would be the man chosen by the government to lead our vast army?
Common sense would tell us that your answer would naturally be Gen. Pershing. Why? Because he has proved his capability as a leader in time of war. On the other hand, should The Cleveland Press make a query asking the entire body of Cleveland citizens whom they would consider the man best qualified to be given the great responsibility of guiding a large city as Cleveland, without a doubt a man like Harry L. Davis would be chosen. He has proved his integrity, intelligence, honesty and loyalty to his fellow citizens of Cleveland..

NO PERMITS
TO VIOLATERS

To the Editor of The Press:
Unless beer dispensing permits are allotted properly they will be handed out to the favored few and of course many of these will prove to be violaters of the 18th amendment.

It would seem to me that no one should be granted this favor unless he is a citizen and only if he has never been arrested for a felony of any kind. This would keep the business in the hands of legitimate people.

NO PERSONAL
INTERESTS

To the Editor of The Press:
The Cuyahoga County Taxpayers' Association was organized as a "property conscious body" interested only in the welfare of the 125,000 overburdened taxpayers in Cuyahoga county. None of the officers of this association are public office holders or candidates for public office and none have political affiliations that might hamper or deter the best interests of this association. One of the chief interests of our organization is to urge strict economy in government. It was with that view in mind that we passed a resolution limiting the power of the Metropolitan Park Board as stated in a bill sponsored by Senator Smolka.
In a letter, purported to be an answer to our resolution, W. A. Stinchcomb, director of the park board, suggests "personal motives actuated the passing of this resolution and```text

PRAISE FOR
MR. SEIPLE

To the Editor of The Press:
 Please accept my thanks for the backing you and your paper are giving the State-City Employment Bureau. Mr. B. C. Seiple and his associates have in my opinion been rendering this community a highly beneficial free employment service for the many thousand clients in all the various labor classifications. I understand he reduced his budget from $26,000 in 1931 to $14,000 this year without cutting service.
 I know many individuals who have secured results from this bureau and it is my sincere hope that you and your paper will continue to oppose any attempt to

```close the State-City Employment
Bureau. Expansion of this bureau
and more employer patronage is
what we need today.

WOMAN, THE
PURSUER
To the Editor of The Press:

Mr. Ordinary Hubby writes you
urging wives to try courting hus-
bands. He is ages late. Women
have pursued men and wives have
courted husbands since history was
first recorded.

Modern economic freedom, so
called, as well as modern ideas of
equality, have only modernized their
methods of pursuit and their skill
in courting.

The fundamental drive motivat-
ing women toward men is a sense
of security. This security may
change in form and degree from
generation to generation. It may
even change in individual women
during their lifetime, but it is al-
ways security against something
that haunts their lives. True, some
women are able to successfully-com-
bat, their individual specters. Others
are fortunate enough to capture the
demon of insecurity in their youth.
Still others change their fears re-
sulting often in the desire to change
the man who was specifically se-
lected to quell the prior fear.

Of course, women advisers advo-
cate that type of procedure which
will make it appear to dumb men
that the woman is actually the ob-
ject of pursuit. This is only nec-
essary because men are too vain
merely to accept her for what she
is. They must win her; they must
overcome her resistance artificially
produced, in order to satisfy them-
selves that she is worth while. If
he doesn't have to struggle to get
her she is not worth while. So she
aptly makes him struggle when all
the time she knows that the only
purpose of the struggle is to con-
vince him that she is worthy of
him.

If he employed just a little com-
mon sense he would observe that
her inherent qualities do not de-
pend upon the tactics employed by
him to demonstrate that he is the
only one. It is said that common
sense and love do not mix. Just
another myth which usually ex-
plodes after marriage. If common
sense is possible after marriage it
has more reason to exist before
marriage. The modern girl differs
only from her grandmother in her
willingness to forsake indirect meth-
ods of pursuit and courting. But
she is pursuing and courting as she
undoubtedly always has.

IT WASN'T
THIS ONE

Recently there appeared in this
