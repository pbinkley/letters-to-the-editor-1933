How the French Scaled Down Their Debts
To the Editor of The Press:
-Letters to the Editor-

At the end of the World War,
France discovered that her national
debt had risen to the equivalent of
$80,000,000,000 against a gold deposit
în her vaults of $2,090,000,000. France
faced the facts. She realized that
employment, bread and butter and
shelter were more important than
retaining her former valuation of
gold.

She revaluated her gold ounce in
the ratio of five to one. She legis-
lated that gold, as far as she was
concerned, was five times more val-
uable in 1930-than it was in 1914.
She declared that a frane was five
times less in value. This meant that
the $80,000,000,000 of the French na-
tional debt was automatically de-
creased in the same proportion. To-
day it represents in modern Ameri-
can money the sum of $16,000,000,000,
one fifth of what it was formerly.

Thirty-six of the 37 nations en-
gaged in the World War practically
followed the example set by France,
either by legislation or through ne-
cessity. We alone have refused to
revalue our gold in spite of the fact
that public and private debts amount
to the staggering total of $235,000,-
000,000 against a gold deposit of ap-
proximately $4,500,000,000. In the face
of these facts, the bankers would

gold dollar would be a "novel ex-
perience" never before attempted by
any nation. You will now naturally
ask how this move on the part of
the French government affected her
business and employment. The
French ambassador says that as of
October 15th, 1932, there were in
France only 251,083 completely out
of work; those with partial work
numbered 12,203. The total popula-
tion of France is 40,785,874. If this
proportion held true in our country
there would be only 750,000 unem-
ployed instead of the 12,000,000 which
we actually have..

I am firmly convinced that before
we escape from the throes of this
depression, we will have revaluated
our gold dollar, banks, financiers and
capitalists to the contrary. By this
I do not mean, as our friends would
have you believe, "inflating" our
currency until it begins to shrink in
value, but I mean "normalizing" our
currency so that a 1929 debt can be
paid with honest 1933 dollars and
not with dollars whose buying power
has reached the unheard of peak of
today. The constitution of this
country invests in Congress full
power to legislate the value of cur-
rency and the sooner they take steps

the
and ourselves on the rond to re-
covery.

I am sure that if all the people
who are interested in seeing "better
times" return to us, would urge their
congressmen and senator to support
gold revaluation, we will get some
quick action in the right direction.

WHY NOT
SWAP CHECKS?
To the Editor of The Press:
With the co-operation of the
banks as an extraordinary measure
for an extraordinary condition, I
see no insuperable reason why the
following plan cannot be carried
out:
Suppose A has money in bank.
The bank cannot at present cash
his check. Suppose A, owing B, or
seeking cash of goods from B, draws
his check, payable to B. The bank
co-operating, certifies this check,
confirming that it owes A the money.
A delivers the certified check to B,
who, having faith in the certifying
bank, accepts it, delivers it by in-
dorsement to C, who, with like faith,
accepts it, and so on. A $10 check
thus circulating could discharge
$1000 of aggregate obligations in a
short time, even as currency can
do. These checks are as good as the
currency, assuming that the certi-
fying banks ultimately redeem them,
which is sure enough for trading
purposes, if, as is claimed, the best
banks of Cleveland are solvent.
If these banks are solvent, and if
the public believe they are solvent
(which faith would also help to keep
and make them solvent) this plan
of course would work, and working,
would bring tremendous relief to
the present paralyzing situation.

THE CRADLE PHONE
OVERCHARGE
I
is one of the nhất users in the
city of Cleveland of the cradle tele-
phone, installed in my office the
first part of 1927. The installation
charge was $5.00 according to my
records, and the initial monthly
charge was 50c. I protested this 50c
charge immediately to the Public
Utilities Commission and evidently
others in the state did likewise, for
the commission compelled the com-
pany then to reduce its monthly
charge to 25e.

I have written to the Public Util-
ities Commission from time to time,
urging that after a person has paid
the 25c charge for a certain length
of time, the charge be discontinued.
This is the only fair and proper
way to handle this matter, but so
far as I can see the Public Utilities
Commission is deaf as a post, and
does not deal with the problem put
up to the commission in this matter.
From my correspondence with the
commission, it seems to them that
this rate on the cradle phone is
wrapped up in the entire rate struc-
ture and regulations of the com-
pany, whereas, it is obvious that it
is not. The sole question is whether
an equitable charge is being levied
upon the people of this state, and I
say that the present charge is ex-

For över six years I have paid 25c
a month for the cradle phone con-
venience, or a total of something
over $18.00 plus an installation
charge of $5.00, which brings the
total to an amount that would pay
for several of these cradle phones
very readily. I have referred to the
commission the fact that in the
District of Columbia the cradle
phone was installed in 1931 on the
basis of a cash payment of $4.00, or
a payment of $4.50 on a time basis.
The Public Utilities Commission
compels the telephone company there
to get its charges down to a rea-
sonable point. On the basis of the
charge at Washington I have paid
for nearly six cradle telephones in
the past six years.
I feel our chief obstacle is the su-
pineness of our Public Utilities Com-
mission. Why should the telephone
company worry when all it has to do
is to tie up its rate structure case
before the commission for six, eight
or some such unending term of
years? Why should people pay taxes
to support such a commission?

SWAT THE RICH?
FORGET IT!
To the Editor of The Press:
After the candid admission by Mr.
Charles E. Mitchell of the New York
National City Bank to a Senate com-
mittee the other day it seems in-
credible that anyone will be so naive
as to assert that the United States
government can ever raise an appre-
clable amount of money by means of
a tax upon large incomes-by "swat-
ting the rich
He frankly confessed that he had
his $25,000 a year salary in bonuses
on stock and bond deals during the
three boom years, 1927, 1928 and
1929. This money was simply given
to him by the National City Co., a
company formed and manned by the
National City Bank to deal in stocks
and bonds in a big way. He ex-
plained that this system of compen-
sating him had been inaugurated
because of his "low" salary, com-
pared to those given "private"
bankers, and Committeeman Couz-
ens, senator from Michigan, asked
him if he believed it to be a good
system. Banker Mitchell promptly
replied, "Yes, I feel very strongly
about it."

And then, but only after persist-
ent questioning by Mr. Pecora, the
counsel for the committee, he dis-
closed the measures he employed in
1929 to evade his income fax. They
were exceedingly simple. He merely
sold stock in his bank to his daugh-
ter at a "loss" of more than $2,500,-
000. After the day for declaring his
income had passed he bought it all
back!
Of course Mr. Mitchell is not an
exception among the considerable
group of American citizens who ob-
tain incomes of that size and in
that manner, nor can it be argued

ing the income tax, eficient as it
surely is, is the only one in vogue
among these people.

So, in making its estimates of the
money the government can raise
from various sources to balance the
budget, Congress would do well to
just forget all about the rich and
turn its attention elsewhere.
