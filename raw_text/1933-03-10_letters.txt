Asks Change in Law Regarding Bank Trust Funds

Letters to the Editor-
To the Editor of The Press:
How many people who create irrevocable trusts for their dependents realize that the laws of Ohio permit the capital structure to be liquidated in the event of the bank failing?
"Impossible!" says the average man. "Trusts are a separate and distinct part of the bank and are treated quite differently."

Nevertheless, it is possible for a portion, and perhaps under certain circumstances the whole trust fund, to be treated as a commercial deposit and subjected to the same restrictions. During the bank chaos many people were suddenly confronted with this and it is time to come out in the open and make clear certain facts.

Let us suppose an irrevocable trust fund is created which, of course, automatically gives full powers to the trust department to invest, sell, etc. This fund will usually be invested largely in government bonds, preferred stocks, and other legalized trust investments. Supposing any or all of the investments should be matured, the trust fund for an indefinite period at the discretion of the trust department, will be in whole or part liquid. Supposing during this period, the bank should suddenly cease payment or, as recently happened, restrict payments, what can happen under existing laws to the cash on hand? Is it held in the trust department for the trustor? It is not; the whole thing is thrown into the pot. Whatever the commercial depositor receives, who incidentally has the right to withdraw his money under normal circumstances at a moment's notice, the tied-hand-and-foot trustor will get the same. Just this has been done by banks recently and the rock-like security which the husband or father felt was in the trust department vanishes overnight.

One bank recently decided that trust fund balances on hand could not be honestly treated as a commercial deposit yet the lawyers shake their heads over the legality of their action. Honesty and sincerity of purpose of a bank in interpreting the word "trust" apparently means nothing. The law says you must fail in your trust and be virtually dishonest. Under the present law, in the final analysis, a bank which is desperate can legally liquidate an irrevocable trust fund and have it on deposit ready for general disposition in case of a run. The word "trust" has suddenly a new meaning and the existing laws are responsible. The need for change is obvious.

HOW PARKS
ARE RUN

To the Editor of The Press:
R. Cass.
Considering the timely and excellent letter written by Mr. Charles G. Irish, regarding the city parks, I am prompted to write a few words from my own experience.

For several years prior to Dec. 1, 1932, I had charge of a small city cemetery Alger. City cemeteries comprise a division of the Depart-
ment of Parks and Public Property.
When I took charge of this cemetery as
it was the custom to rake up all
leaves and loose organic matter
each fall to be burnt. I started a
system of storing the leaves in a
pit, mixing in some good soil, sharp
sand and, if possible, some commer-
cial fertilizer or lime to aid in de-
composition. Some of this material
was later used wherever a summer
mulch seemed advisable, and the
balance was thoroughly worked into
our top soil pile just prior to the
succeeding autumn rake-up. By this
means we increased materially our
supply of friable, moisture-holding,
reasonably rich top soil without
much cost, as the labor of conserv-
ing this organic matter is surely
not much greater than that required
to destroy it.

In this cemetery there are a great
many plantings of tulips and other
spring flowering bulbs and as most
of these are put in by lot-owners
their locations are not always defi-
nitely known
For this reason it was my custom
to allow fallen leaves to remain on
Bower beds and bare spots over win-
ter. I never considered them more
unsightly than the bare spots of
earth which their removal would
'occasion.

On Dec. 1, in the interests of the
Democratic organization and in de-
flance of the spirit of civil service
regulations, I was laid off. This, in
spite of the fact that I had no po-
litical backing when appointed, that
I broke into cemetery work as a
working, not nominal laborer, and
that I was one of the few civil serv
ice employees who was obliged to
pass his examination before being
put on a salary basis. This in no
way affects an individual's ability
to supervise the care of a cemetery
or a park, my voting has been pre-
dominantly Democratic heretofore.

Immediately after Dec. 1, I no-
ticed the development of a spirited
activity in the removal of the leaves
which I had purposely allowed to
remain on the cultivated spaces and
I was sorry to see that instead of
these being put on our pile they
were thrown on the refuse dumps to
be burned.

Just yesterday I noticed where
about two-thirds of the bulbs in a
shallow planting of tulips had been
heaved up and were lying on the
surface of the ground because of
the temperature, variations of our
open winter.

Of course the covering of loose
leaves even carelessly spread would
have helped to prevent this upheaval
otherwise would probably have been a beautiful flower bed this spring. James T. Coughlin 16720 Bradgate avenue.

MIND IN
THE GUTTER?

To the Editor of The Press! In The Press of March 7, in the column written by the town's scavenger, Jack Raper, near the top he was commenting on the newspaper report that former President Hoover slept for 12 hours the first night that he was out of the White House, his comment was to the effect that Hoover slept for four years while he occupied the White House.

I understand why attempts are made to assassinate presidents and why crazed men run amuck in Cleveland and kill innocent men and women.

On the front page of your paper you carried a Bible quotation and on your editorial page you run the comments of a man whose mind is always in the gutter, a man who makes his money by attacking public officials all the way from the president down. If you think conndence will be restored with comments such as the one I refer to, go right ahead. I for one resent it and I have talked to other subscribers who feel the same way. Emil A. Greene.

WILL SOME
ONE EXPLAIN

To the Editor of The Press: As one of the million saps I wonder if I may get a hearing?

You hear little from the common herd like myself, but we all go along like saps, and yet they call us educated as a nation. In your paper of Jan. 9, I see where a bill is up proposing a bounty for farmers reducing their production of wheat, etc., and to raise prices to pre-war levels.

Also it is stated there are 500,000 persons in the Kentucky and West Virginia mining fields in immediate need of food and clothing. Nine-tenth of the children are seriously undernourished. Does it not seem idiotic to pay somebody or farmers to cut down the crops while on the other hand you have 500,000 persons in one small area in need of the very thing the government seeks to have production reduced on?

Also on the other hand we are being taxed to death to keep our fellowmen alive. Will some technocrat, Democrat, or what have you, figure this out? H. Williams
