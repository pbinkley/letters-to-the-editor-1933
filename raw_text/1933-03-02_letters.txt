Suggests Commercial Scrip to Aid Business
-Letters to the Editor-
To the Editor of The Press:
Inasmuch as those banks which have restricted withdrawals did not see fit to make an exception of commercial accounts which are the life of trade, perhaps this suggestion may furnish an expedient substitute. If the owner of a commercial account will write a check for $10 to the order of cash and take it to his bank, and if the bank will place a stamp thereon, indorsed, "The Maker of This Check Has Not Issued Checks Like This in a Greater Amount Than His Commercial Deposit in This Bank," said check can then be used as scrip in the purchase of any commodity of the payment of any bill to anyone who will be willing to accept same in absolute payment of an obligation of $10.
If this practice becomes universal, a new form of currency or commercial barter will have created itself without almost any mechanics. By the time the check has been used a dozen times, we can hope the present situation will have been so relieved, that the bank will be in a position to honor the payment of the check. With the indorsement as suggested, it is the same as a certified check, except that the bank is under no compulsion to honor payment, but by its indorsement furnishes a prospective taker with the information that the maker of the check has sufficient funds in nis commercial account, but obviously must await its withdraw until the bank voluntarily lifts the restriction or is in such a position that it can and must do so.
Large bills can be paid to creditors, who are willing, by the required number or as many checks of $10 as such creditor may be willing to take. In other words such a check would act as a $10, bill... If the worst-comes to worst the creditor will have one or more $10 checks on his hands, depending on the number - such creditor is willing to carry at one time. In the meantime, regardless of its ultimate value, the check has served as a medium of exchange. It will also make liquid the stagnant account.
A $10 bill has, of course, gold behind it. The check will have $10 behind it but in additiori, the uncertainty of exchange payment in legal tender. For most part this mv well be disregarded in the face of the advantages and compensations attached thereto,
Checks could be written in larger amounts, but they would not pass as easily. Under this plan some schemes might be suggested which might work a fraud. The praba-bility is that such practices would not be any different than those perpetrated in normal times without the present restrictions. Our present laws would be sufficient to take care of such. A party could not issue checks in a greater amount than his commercial deposits, otherwise the foregoing indorsement could not be secured from the bank.
If the banks are willing to co-operate in this plan and permit savings accounts to be converted into checking, there is no reason why considerable hardship cannot be eliminated and the banks' depositors will have much to be thankful for.

CENSURE
FOR WETS
To the Editor of The Press:
Gov. White is to be commended for his stand in opposition to the repeal of state enforcement laws
prior to ratification of the repeal
amendment. However much the
wets in the Assembly think they
have a mandate to provide for such
a vote, present dissatisfaction with
the status quo everywhere would
prevent the voters calm considera-
tion of the results of such action
and repeal would mean only the in-
tensification of present conditions of
lawlessness which they pretend to
deplore. This certainly shows up
most of the wets in their true light,
not as advocates of temperance, but
in their lust for drink real enemies
of law and order.

As to the ratification of said
amendment there seems to be little
doubt at present, as wets are deter-
mined to put every obstacle in the
way of enforcement so that even
sincere drys will be forced to accept
their proposals.

Your paper deserves, censure by all
right-thinking people for advo-
cating such a course. The recent
sneers in your news columns at tem-
perance in the matter of strong
drink being emphasized on the day
set aside by the state for such teach-
ing in our schools merely illustrates
a case in point.

After all, repeal may be what is
needed to bring some short mem-
oried wets back to their senses-a
few years of free flowing booze and
they may unite in calling for-more
rigid control than was ever before
attempted. Fred W. Rose

WANTED:
A MAYOR

To the Editor of The Press:

I cannot see why the city of
Cleveland cannot have as a candi-
date for mayor a man who has the
ability to run the city for the benefit
of the citizens.

There are such men in the city
of Cleveland who have run in the
past and who would run now but
they could not affiliate themselves
with either of the large parties be-
cause the corruption which has
crept into these parties. There are
men like Mr. D. Cull who has all
the qualifications for this position
but would run as an independent.
Daniel Morgan in my estimation is
well qualified for the position but
who would not run under the lead-
ership of the Republican Party.

The last election the people in the
city of Cleveland had an opportu-
nity to elect a man in the position
of mayor, namely Peter Witt, who
would have served them well, but
their eyes were dimmed by the
prattle and promises of the profes-
sional politician and as a res√ºlt our
city is in a terrible situation.

Let us hope that in the next elec-
tion the people in the city of Cleve-
land will not take voting as a mat-
ter of course, but will give it con-
siderable thought, because if they
don't, not only in the city but
throughout the country, there is go-
ing to be a change in the former
government. I do not say that this
change will be for the better but it
will be a change and it will be bul-
lets rather than ballots. W. A. Krider.

PASSING
FRONTIERS

To the Editor of The Press:
James Truslow Adams, in his
book called "Epic of America," says,
"The average man in all our modern
democracies is no more of a trained
economist than our westerners were
in 1896. With the immense fall in
price of silver and declining produc-
tion of gold, which the League of
Nations states will reach a crisis ins
1940, with the world loaded with
debts payable in currency value of
1918, we are already beginning to
hear of the demand for a new and
more scientific basis for currency-
that is a cheaper money to cause
inflation for trade and make the
payment of debt easier for the
debtor. In a sense, Europe is today
the new economic frontier of
America."
Under President Hoover, who was
considered the great engineer, we
enacted tariff that almost staggered
us with the prohibitive height to
which duties were raised, in spite
of the fact that we insisted upon
collection from other nations of over
$11,000,000:000 in loans, even the in-
terest on which could only be paid
by selling goods to us.
We know that there are no new
gold fields to be discovered. First
railroads in America were built by
new supplies of gold found in Sacra-
mento in 1849. Our agrarian em-
pire which lies west of the Missis-
sipi River and the boom of big busi-
ness, manufacture and commerce on
the eastern sea-coastal plan, were
stimulated by Civil War plus gold
fields discovered in the Rocky
Mountains in 1864..
Unparalleled orgy of stock mar-
ket with its wild speculation ended
in the disastrous collapse of 1929,
because vast structure was built
upon credit. It was the natural
outcome of the great prosperity of
big business, manufacture and com-
merce in our country.

AGREES WITH
WHAT'S WRONG

To the Editor of The Press:
Arthur Dainley in Friday's Press
wrote an article on what's wrong
with radio. I sincerely agree with
him. Nowadays we seldom hear
good music. I think we ought to
have more organ music instead of
dizzy orchestras all the time.
I enjoy reading Norman' Siegel's
radio column. He has a sense of
humor which other radio editors
lack
