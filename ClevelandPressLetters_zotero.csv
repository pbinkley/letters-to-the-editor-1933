Women have pursued men and wives have courted husbands since: history, was first recorded. Modern economic freedom, called, as well as modern ideas of equality, have only modernized their methods of pursuits and their skill in courting. The fundamental drive, motivating women toward men is a sense of security. This security may. change in form and degree from generation to generation. It may even change in individual: women during their lifetime, but it is always security against something that haunts their lives. True; some women are able to successfully com bat. theif individual specters. Others are fortunate enough to capture the demon of insecurity in their -youth. Still others change their fears suiting often in the desire to change the man"" who was specifically sex lected to quell the prior fear.

I express to your newspaper my pleasure at seeing. the recent news columns devoted to the Detroit banking situation and in particular to: its chief figure -the Rev. FT. Charles E.

To the Editor of The Pore: On March 16, 1933, an article appeared in your paper stating that the Irish -American Democratic. League of. Cuyahoga County, under the directorship of Walter: G.; O'Donnell, president of the league, had organized that two three clubs are on in the process West of Side, forma- and a tion on the East Side. As a strong believer In unity, I beleve in organization, and especially if the purpose of the organization is to elevate our Irish race in: political and civil life I think Mr. O'Donnell should have stated where those two clubs are formed on the West Side and what names they go under, o that the Irish people in that vicinity might have the opportunity, to join such clubs if they belleve in such organi-those zations, •There are two Irish *American Democratic clubs formed on the West Side that I am aware of, the West Park and the West Side Irish American Democratic clubs, located at Lorain avenue and 135th street and Detroit avenue and 101st street; respectively.

These savings are entitled to the greatest safeguards that our government can throw about them. I therefore wish to make the following suggestions; I suggest that our Postal Savings banks be so expanded that they"" ac- | cept time deposits, in unlimited amounts and that these depostts be invested in first mortgages on homes occupied owners and farms operated by their owners.

Those who seek larger returns could patronize: private savings banks. The government is under no necessity of paying huge bonuses to officers or making large loans to influential directors It would be under no pressure to pay fat dividends to stockholders regardless of earnings. It could therefore limit its interest charges on these loans to 3. or 3½ per cent. This would guarantee deposits of who sought safety and reduce hoarding considerably, It would prevent recurring epidemics of foreclosures, as the government being the mortgage, could at will declare : temporary moratoriums. There would be no cost to the taxpayers, as the interest rates: could be adjusted to make the project selfsupporting.

Examining further, the unemployment solution would take the form ot indenturing (read enslaving) all the unemployed until there would be &amp; standing ""pauper"""" class working under prison fundia conditions and discipline, All the unemployed would eventually pass. into ""prison"" camps. Taxes which now feed the R. F. C. and provide the disemployed some relief has already Impoverished the middle classes which can stand no more.

Phillip Bartell. ANOTHER REVALUATOR $ To the Editor of The Press: The monetary gold reserve of the world on Jan. 1,-1933, was $12,050,- 000,000. The total indebtedness of the world, that is, obligations payable"" in gold, amounts to $316,000,, - 000,000. While these debt payments. mature through a long succession of -years there is not sufficient gold in reserve in the world to pay interest on the principal of the world's debts without completely draining the gold reserve of the debtor nations. At the rate of increase at. which gold is going to, monetary use. a panic in monetary gold: will continue. Thus, it is obvlous that the largest creditor nations are ""golng to continue to drain the serves of the debtor nations, and force them to sell their products at any price obtainable in order to get the gold with which to meet their obligations. The inal results are loss and chaos to every nation in the world «that is engaged sin international. commerce. Wage and living stand. ards will remain impoverished, unemployment will continue, agriculture will continue to suffer, and under-consumption will continue. The concentration of money. will continue, which situation has proved disastrous to the common wealth of all nations. from the beginning of organized governments. The questions arise as to' what should be done to avoid further oppression of the debtor nations by the creditor, nations and how to mpletely eradicate unemployment ahong all nations, thereby restoring happiness, prosperity, and the blessedness of good will among the whole of civilization. 11 my Jogic is correct, the plan to follow is this: 1: Readjust or cancel tional monetary obligations. (a)It is as unreasonable for a nation to remain &amp; creditor nation' and also a competitor as it would be for a Chain store monopoly to loan money to interests which operate in competition the chain. (b)On account of our natural resources the United States cannot afford to remain a creditor nation. 2:4 Revaluate the troy ounce of gold to at least $60 per ounce 1000 fine.

Nina FISHERMEN PROTEST CLOSING OF RIVERS To the Editor of The Press: The writers of this letter to you represent thousands. of fishermen, taxpayers and voters, who de desire to bring forth another side of Mr. Stinchcomb's order closing Rocky River Ashing. seems arbitrary and discriminatory. &amp; Regardless of the merits or demerits of spring fishing in general, it is a fact that state of onio did not make it Illegal fish until May 1. - Mr. Stinchcomb's ruling represents his own personal opinion and perhaps that of some other fishermen who do not exactly understand the true conditions. We who fish Rocky River particularly, are. most seriously /affected by this ruling. It Is an obvious fact that event if this stream were closed, it would be of no direct benefit to the Metropolitan Park system, or to the Ashcrmen Cleveland at large. It would rather be a benefit to those people outside Cleveland own property bordering migratory streams flowing into Lake Erie. Migratory streams, as you know, are streams which fish use during the spawning season and from which, at the completion of spawning, they River return is whence- they came: Rocky one of these streams, and the fish that : use it are products Lake Erie. At the close of- the spawning season they return either in the lake: to islands or to similar reefs Regarding the ""slaughter fish"" to, which Mr. Stinchcomb -refers, that was due entirely to the faulty construction of, the concrete - ramp Lacross the river, which did not permit the fish to pass. Thanks to Mr. Stinchcomb, this has been corrected, and the fish now have at least the same chance they have in other rivers. The Idea, then, of not permitting Cleveland people to fish in their own public park- In order to -help -the Ashermen of # Sandusky, Huron, Erie, Vermilion, etc., seems to us discriminatory, inasmuch as It has a yet to be proven that bass return to spawn where they themselves were spawned. If Fit were # general thing throughout the state to: close all streams to spring fishing, you would find us among the most willing to co-operate.' Under the circumstances, however, we are naturally unwilling to &amp; be deprived of the sport. which our own money helps to buy and maintain You doubtless know. that property owners along the nearby migratory streams * *make a, charge, usually a50 rents, for the privilege of fishing from -their land: That is fine for those who have the 50 cents and the price of getting there, but how about those who don't have it?

What littie food they had was mostly unfit for human consumption. In this the government was negltgent. * Men of the Seventh Corps camped on for four swampy ground near Jacksonville months, until practically three-fourths of them were ill with typhoid, malaria and intestinal diseases.

Miller played at the St. Patrick dinner gave vent to the assertion that his ancestors came from Ireland. To terminate the speculation I did a little Investigating and found that he Is neither of this origin notias was also claimed-of Holland Dutch or Bohemian extraction, but that he is originally &amp; German-that is German as the grandson of a German immigrant could be -under the circumstances. His mother is of pure Irish stock. The grandfather was Joachim Mueller of Deflance,"" who came to Ohio: the year -1850. Before- his emigration he lived in the village of Moellenbeck near Grabow in Mecklenburg-Shwerin. Poverty was the general lot of the Miral Germans in those: days, and the Mueller family fortuno was not. exceptional. Joachim* Juergen Mueller had married, Dorothes Elizabetn Krueger and was struggling to matitain his. young wife and. two children. Many Germans were emigrating to America at that time. The emigration. after the revolution of 1848 was the biggest of the century. So Mueller Joined the thrang of emigrants and settled in Defiance, where the original: Mueller-Amertcan homestead still stands. In America, Mueller, a sturdy and energetic man, prospered beyond anything he, might have hoped -for in the fatherland. He became lumber dealer and teaming contractor of parts.

Martin Edward grew up in Deflance and married. Ann Riley, an Irish girl; who is identified today as the handsome: gray-haired woman; scen frequently with the mayor and Mrs. Miller--the mayor's mother. The old German family name, had, however, changed to the English ""Miller,"" long before: the mayor's father left. the paternal root to found a home of his own. And thereby hangs a tale. Joachim Juergen Mueller's bustness was growing in the years when pioneer communication and transportation In Ohio was being developed by the old canals., The elder Muciler aceded a boat to navigate the canal between Toledo and Cincinnati, and hired -a-ship-bullding contractor to build her. The contractor: turned out to be an excellent ship builder but a pretty poor speller. On the day. the new boat was scheduled to make her first voyage, it was discovered: that, she had to haye &amp; name. ""Name her Joachim,"" the owner said. ""That's my Christian ""Joachim,"" the contractor mused ""what's that?"" He had never heard the name nor did he know how to spell it. Left to his own devices. and his employer not being handy to be consuited. the contractor just printed ""Jo Miller"" on the boat's prow. The ship's papers had to be made out and signed by the proprietor those same was. alicgedly on the prow. *The. Mueller business under the English name very, became known as ""J.

HONOR TO ALL GOOD MOTHERS To tha Editor of The Press: *Mrs, Otelis Compton made, doctor of laws by Western College because she reared three famous sons"" was a very rare news published by this paper some time ago. This distinction may not mean anything at all. But it 1s a challenge of the recently. propounded Idea that respect for mothers is just another ""sentimental slush."" We attach sentiment in the making of great men and women. We honor order to induce others to strive for the sama high Now, why are some people against respect ind honor ol good mothers is a puzzle to me. Don't we need good mothers? If so, why not encourage. them in this dificult. job Just as we do in case of great states. manship or scientific pursuits of high standing. Yes, some bad mothers take advantage of it for their sclfish purposes; but so do some other unscrupulous men and women to oth er fields of human activities. These are comparatively very-few-and it is almost impossible to eradicate them altogether. The time may come when the state will take care of children and we shall not reed especially good mothers. But at the present and for a long time to come yet we must help every mother to become a rcally good mother. For general-happlness' sake let us give credit to all good mothers! Frank Junkar E. 40th and Hough avenue DONT CLOSE BLOSSOM HILL To the Editor of The Press: wonder why. Mayor Miller wishes to close Blossom Hill. It is true that expenses should decrease. but to take from these 75 children the splendid training that such environment and superviston is indelibly painting upon their futures is a setious phing.

I greatly respect the opinions expressed by your newspaper, but this is one instance in which my views as to the best interests of the people whom I * represent differ from yours. Under the law. as it now exists, where bonds are to be issued for the construction of &amp; municipal light plant, bridge or other, improvement by a political subdivision. of the state, 60 per cent of the voters must vote in favor of a tax levy required for. the payment of interest and principal on such : bonds. (Assuming, as is usually. the case, po. levy within the 15-mill limitation is possible.) The Ward Bill ""changes this 60. is laudable one of requiring a per cent, to 65 per cent. Its purpose greater percentage. of voters to approve the issuance bonds: which would increase taxes. The Senate amendment purported to reduce the 60 per cent of the present law and the :65 per cent of: the to only 55-per cent+ where -the - proposed were ""municipally owned. water, electric works, systems for services, or transportation routes for systems."" *Your newspaper. is of the opinion that: this? raises an Issue between the people who want.

I do not believe such an issue is raised, but: I belleve that the Issue raised one between the people who pay? taxes and thosed politicians who want to spend them on municipal water, electric and gas works and &amp; municipal street roads. * It would clearly be wrong if the Ward bin, or the present law, required any vote of the people when bonds were to be issued for the construction * or expansion of a sound. municipal public utility. Nothing in the present law for the Ward bill affects the Ohio constitation provides for the issuance of mortgage: bonds for the expansion: or ""construction of municipally owned public utilities. Article 18, Section 12 *of the constitution provides: ""Any municipality: which acquires, constructs or extends ' any public. utility and desires to raise money for such, purposes may issue mort: gage bonds therefor beyond the general limit of bonded indebtedness* prescribed a by law; provided that such mortgage bonds: issued beyond the general limit of. bonded indebledness prescribed by law shall not impose any lability upon such municipality but shall be secured only upon the property and revenues of such public utility, Include ing franchise stating the terms upon which, in case of foreclosure, the purchaser: may operate the same, which franchise shall in 'no case extend: for a longer period 20 years from the date of the sale, of such utility and franchise. on foreclosure.""

He is the sign of a ""new era"" of personal naturalness. Or, put another way, the symbol of a new brand of showmanship. Hoover's trouble' was not wholly the fact that he lacked the spark plug of direct action, or that he was the standard-bearer. of an archaic political philosophy. A part of his trouble was he was acting a part foreign to his temperament. He was acting like he thought a president ought to act, instead of acting like himself. , Lincoln's secret was in being himself-a subtle form'of consumate showmanship. Roosevelt has the same knack. To date, the public psychology regarding the election of a president has been a curtous and'a devious thing, As a people, we have insisted on camouflaging our presidents We have made them play the part of a compostte, that composite being the personification t of whatever the mass hopes and aims and tions of the moment might Considered realistically, the presidente of the United.

The final payment of $70,- 000 and Interest in full was made to the Union Trust Co. on March 1, 1933. All mortgages owned by the Atlas Savings &amp; Loan Co. are now in the company's vault.

It has been privilege the writer to close and careful analysis of the affairs of this instttution during the past year and to have accumulated some figures as to Its solvency. These may be of interest. This computation indicates that the Standard was heavily deficient In assets. The total deficiency, was: $8,545,826.84, divided into $2,213,092.66 as to current labilities and $6,332,-, 734,18. 8.8 to fixed liabilities. These figures are: as of the closing date of Dec, 19, 1931. There is also evidence. proving that this- institution* was dangerously near if not actually insolvent as of its date of opening in March, 1930.

But the standards or ship and the renabinty of its members are paramount and each and applicant tor a membership must necessarily prove that he is. worthy of the name; Master Painter and Decorator. During the past several months the chapter has been working on a definite program which tends to create in the industry. better craftsmanship, reliability and an honest -effort to carry out each ""and every contract, which may be entered into by its members. To this end, the chapter has set up 10 very definite standards. and principals, which it feels will create the ideals toward which It is working. These are summarized as fol 1st: To our friendships get acquainted with our colleagues in the same line of endeavor. - To obtain- for your craft the of the 3d:. To improve and make workting conditions more satisfactory 4th: To promote good legislation and oppose passage of unfair laws. 5th To. better our relations with [architects and general contractors. 6th: To interest the manufac* turer of the materials which we use in our place and rights in the pro= motion of the welfare of the totire Industry 7th: To: deal with #labor on equal organized basis, * Star To our the modern methods of estimating on the basis of cost. finding. •9th: To co-operate in promulgatting codes of practice advertising and creating good will for our trade. 10th: * To give to our members that human touch of interest which is exemplified through our sick, welfare and goodwill committees, * The chapter, members have no desire whatsover to go out and secure jobs in any other than an honest and, ethicalsmanner and to this end there been created a very definite and concrete plan which affords the customer a protection as well- as an assurance of having the job done right.

This meant that the $80,000.000,000 of the French national . debt was automatically decreased in the same proportion. Today It represents in modern: Ameri-1 can money the sum of $16,000.000,000, one nith of what it was formerly. Thirty-six of the 37 nations engaged in the World War practically followed the example set by* France, either by legisiation or through necesalty. We alone have retuned .to revalue our gold in' spite of the fact that public and private debts amount to the staggering total of $235,000, 000,000 against a gold deposit of approximately: In the Tate of these the gold dollar would be a ""novel experience"", never before attempted by any nation. You will now naturally ask how this move on the part of the French government affected her business and employment. The French ambassador says that as of October 15th, 1932, there were. In France only 251,083 completely out of work; those with partial work numbered 12,203. The total population of Prance is 40,785,874. If this proportion held true in our country there would be only 750,000 unemployed instead of the 12,000,000 which we actually have. *I am firmly convineed that before we escape from the throes of: this depression, we: will have revaluated: our gold dollar, banks, financiers and capitalists to the contrary, By this I do not mean as our friends would have you &amp; believe, our currency until to shrink In value, but I mean ""pormalizing** our currency so that a 1929 debt. can be paid with: honest 1833 dollars and not with. dollars whose buying power has reached the unheard 'of peak of today, d.

As a former Cincinnatian, and one who had, a very small part in launching the present city government, think you -could also have mentioned the following points. In spite of economical: operation, Cincinnati has a police and fire department which will bear: compartson with the best in the country. Their waste * collection: system is thorough. and' tellable, not the hit or miss proposition It is here. The school system is one of the best in the - country, while the city maintaing a municipal university which attracts: students from. all over. the world.: All these: services, besides others of a more distinctive thatacter, are provided for out of a tax rate considerably lower than that of Cleveland, Just to mention one. of the ""distinctive Cincinnati projects. I recall an item in one of the papers recently mentioning the fact that tho: Public Library had the best • of- Braille books for the blind in the United: States and that. it was taxtensively used throughout the country. In my Judgment Cleveland doomed its manager. form of government to fallure the start by the reten tion of the large, locally elected, council, poorly: paid 'and therefore open. to. party manipulation. cinnati only has nine, councilmen, elected at large and paid well enough to make them less susceptible to influence from selfishly motivated interests.

WANTS MORE CURRENCY To the Editor of The This bank limitation of 5 per cent on withdrawals that has just reached Cleveland reminds one of the recent made: by Secretary Mills that the total bank deposits in the U; S. A. amounts to $46,000,000,000 and the actual cash in the U. S. A. amounts to less than $6,000,000,000. If our Congress would now print $40,000,000,000 * In currency there would then be just enough money in the country to cover the bank des posits and if our government shouldttrie print $40,000,000,000 on its own instead of the usual ""bank notes"" and loan the same. to refinance farm and home loans at'2 per cent inter* est, the revenue to the government would almost balance the budget and, at the same time force down all Interest rates to 2 per cent and thus sAve '8 diffcrence in interest burden on the American people of 4 per cent average. on the -200,000,000,000 total of interest bearing debts, or: $8,000,- This $8,000,000,000 à year saving to the people -would automalically.

In one breath he* expresses concern about: the March 5 elections and that Hitler will drive the Jews from Germany and in the next, the rabble likens Hitler to Mussolini How can the -make such a comparison when it is common knowledge that in the years Mussolini has been in power, the Jews in Italy have recelved better treatment and more consideration than -in any, other country in the world. Should such a thing happen in.
