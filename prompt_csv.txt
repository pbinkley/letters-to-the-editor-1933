Divide the text into letters according to the following rules.  

1. Letters have titles, which are followed by a line similar to "To the Editor of the Press".

2. The author's name is found at the end of the letter's text and is right-justfied.

3. The author's name might be followed by a location, either a street address or a town near Cleveland. It is also right-justified.

Once all letters have been identified with their titles and authors, create a CSV file with these columns: 'Title', 'Author', 'Location', 'Subjects', Summary', and 'Text'. Add a row for each letter. Follow these rules:

1. It is extremely important to ensure the CSV file is correctly formatted, with all text enclosed in quotation marks and appropriately escaped (including line breaks), so that it can be easily parsed by standard CSV readers.

2. The title should be converted to title case.

3. The summary is a single-sentence summarizing the main subject or argument of the letter.

4. The subjects should be selected exclusively from this list: "City Politics", "State Politics", "National Politics", "Economy", "World Events". Insert all that apply, separated by pipe characters.

5. Format the text as a single paragraph. Where words are hyphenated at the end of a line, remove the hyphenation.
