    "summary": "The author, W. A. Stinchcomb, director of the Cleveland Metropolitan Park District, disputes the claims made by The Cuyahoga County Taxpayers' Association regarding park district tax levies. Stinchcomb explains that park boards have stringent controls over their tax levies and emphasizes that the association's demands for legislative repeal are unnecessary. He argues that park districts' access to tax funds is strictly regulated, pointing out that the Budget Commission has never allowed the full one-tenth mill levy and that voters themselves control the maximum allowable amount through voted levies. Stinchcomb also provides an estimate of potential tax revenue from the current approved levies and refutes the notion that park districts are irresponsibly seeking additional funds.",

    "text": "MR. STINCHCOMB EXPLAINS PARK TAXES\n\n Letters to the EditorTo the Editor of The Press: I am herewith submitting certain facts with reference to tax levies authorized for Park District purposes.\n\nA published article referred to reports a meeting of \"The Cuyahoga County Taxpayers' Association\" at the Statler Hotel, in which unanimous action was taken, asking the Legislature to support a bill repealing sections of the statutes, which, it is alleged, empower Metropolitan Park boards to make tax assessments without applying to the Budget Commission.\n\nThere are two provisions in the park laws by means of which, park districts may obtain tax funds. Section 2976-10 authorizes park boards to make application to the Budget Commission for a levy which cannot exceed one-tenth of 1 mill. This levy comes within the 15-mill limitation and is subject to revision and review by the Budget Commission. In no Park District in Ohio has the Budget Commission of the respective districts ever allowed the full one-tenth mill. In the Cleveland Metropolitan Park District for 1932 and 1933 the rate allowed has been .05 of a mill.\n\nThe other provision for tax levy is contained in Section 2976-101, which permits park boards to submit to the electorate, the question of authorizing a levy which at no submission can exceed one-tenth of 1 mill. Money so obtained by voted levies, is used for capital investment in land and permanent improvements. Levies approved by the Budget Commission may be used for either operation or capital investment.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it is apparent that the strictest kind of control is exerted on park levies. In the first place the maximums allowed are the lowest maximums provided in the statutes for any political subdivision and in the case of the general levy, it comes within the 15-mill maximum limit and is subject to control by the Budget Commission. In the case of the voted levies, it is limited to a maximum of one-tenth of 1 mill at any submission and is controlled by the electorate itself.\n\nBased upon present tax duplicate, it was estimated when the budgets were approved in January, that a full one-tenth mill levy would provide about $155,000. It is apparent that this is now not likely to exceed $100,000. On the other hand, it was estimated that the .05 of a mill authorized by the Budget Commission would amount to approximately $76,000. This, by reason of probable delinquencies will be correspondingly reduced to not in excess of $50,000,\n\nIt might be interesting to investigate the personal motives actuating those in signing resolutions by this association\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx when we should keep our heads cool and our feet on the ground and every effort should be made to prevent the development of hysteria which might result in actions which would be greatly regretted when the present crisis clears. A W. A. Stinchcomb, Director. ",

    "summary": "The author, Newman Jeffrey, writes in response to the German consul's claim about Social Democratic newspapers being suspended for undermining government authority. They argue that the suppression was actually part of a broader crackdown on various press outlets, including Catholic newspapers that supported the German Constitution and opposed the current government's use of terrorism. The letter cites the Reichstag fire as a politically motivated act likely carried out by agents of the government to discredit the opposition ahead of elections.",

    "text": "A SOCIALIST ANSWER TO GERMAN CONSUL\n\n To the Editor of The Press: In your issue of March 4 Mr. W. Friebel, acting German consul of Cleveland, states that the Social Democratic newspapers in Germany were suspended due to the fact that such papers had lately consistently undermined the authority of the government. We wish to take exception to this statement which is at utter variance with the facts known to all impartial students of the political situation in Germany.\n\nThe Social Democratic newspapers were suppressed together with a great part of the Catholic press, which certainly cannot be accused of being revolutionary, for the reason that they upheld the German Constitution and opposed by legitimate means the terroristic government which stands today revealed before the world as guilty of the darkest crimes it pretends to fight. The burning of the Reichstag, in spite of denials of Mr. Friebel, was apparently a clumsy trick of the agents of the present government. Since the time of Nero, who burned Rome in order to throw blame on the Christians, there is no deed of political provocation more outstanding than this burning of the Reichstag on the eve of the elections to German Parliament.\n\nWe condemn the terrorist government of Germany for its brutal suppression of all opposition and declare our solidarity with German Social Democrats and all German workers fighting for political-freedom, social justice and international peace.\n\nNewman Jeffrey, Secretary Socialist Party of Cleveland.

    "text": "THE TROUSER SUIT CURE\n\n To the Editor of The Press:\n\nMarian Parson, in reply to my recent criticism, states that she did have on her thinking cap when she advocated trouser suits for women as a cure for the depression.\n\nIt is said that 2 per cent of the people own 90 per cent of the wealth of this country. If this is correct, 98 per cent of the people have little or no purchasing power. Consequently it is absurd to assume that a probable buying factor of 2 per cent can overcome a positive sales resistance of 98 per cent.\n\nMoreover, the women of this country who have wealth have not been waiting for the ballyhoo of some sales drummer to buy what they want or what they like. These women usually know what they want, why they want it and, when they want it. Furthermore, they are very choicy in their tastes and carefully avoid adopting anything that the \"common\" women are going to wear. As for the latter class of women, as stated, they have no money; in fact, most of them have already bought more than they can pay for.\n\nEven, were all women on a basis of economic equality and had sufficient available funds, the substitution of one style of garment for another could not produce prosperity. would make others poor. Don't we well remember the conflict between rayon and wool? Some wood fiber spinners became affluent but sheep raisers and wool knitters went to the wall. We now have artificial silk mills in Cleveland, but where are Wooltex and others?\n\nMy advice. is, that women become sensible and self-conscious and no longer permit themselves to become the victims of fashion mongers and other exploiters of their sex, all of whom are operating for private gain and have not in yiew the public good.
