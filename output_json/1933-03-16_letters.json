He has been in office for only a short length of time but has accomplished much and has gained the confidence of the people in this country. He was not afraid to state his ideas and plans and at the same time he succeeded in them.\n\nI listened to his radio talk Sunday, March 12, and I thought it was given in a very clear and concise manner. Subjects concerning banks were explained so simply that practically anyone could understand them. He has moved swiftly in his methods to clear up the banking system and at the same time has restored the confidence of the people in the banks. Once more we will be able to entrust our money in the banks without the constant fear of not being able to receive it back.\n\nThe president's wife has also shown a wonderful example to the country. She has been constantly by the side of her husband and has tried to aid him to the greatest possible extent.\n\nA great many of the people appreciate the things that are being accomplished by the president and are only too glad to co-operate with him. Here's hoping that he will be able to lead us out of this financial difficulty we have fallen into and show us the good and prosperous times again. Josephine Masar. ",
