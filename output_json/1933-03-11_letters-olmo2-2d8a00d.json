    "summary": "The letter raises concerns about a bill proposed in the Legislature that increases the tenure of the state superintendent of banks from two years to six years. The author argues that this change would limit the frequency of his review by the State Senate and suggests it might make the removal of the official 'practically impossible.' Additionally, the author expresses concern about the provision that the superintendent can only be removed by the governor for 'cause,' which he believes makes it difficult to prove in the case of banks. He calls for community organizations to review the bill before it is passed.",

    "text": "QUESTIONS PROPOSED TENURE OF BANK SUPERINTENDENT\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nTo the Editor of The Press: I wonder if your readers are aware of a banking bill before the Legislature which increases to six years the tenure of office of the state superintendent of banks? This very important appointive officer now has a tenure of only two years, and since his appointment must be confirmed by the State Senate his position comes under review by representatives of the people much more frequently than is proposed under the new law.\n\nThe writer has looked into the question of tenure in a number of other states and finds none of those investigated granting so long a period. The following indicates the situation in those states:\n\nWisconsin, five years; Michigan, two years; New Jersey, three-years; West Virginia, four years; New York, two years; Massachusetts, three years; Connecticut, four years; Illinois, four years; Minnesota, titred years,\n\nIn Wisconsin the commissioner of banking is at all times under the strict supervision of a Banking Board of Review, and hence his appointment for five years is understandable, for his acts are carefully guarded. The other states desire to review the acts of this important official at more frequent intervals.\n\nThe proposed bill also provides that this officer can be removed only by the governor and only for cause. The writer believes this provision practically makes impossible the removal of the superintendent as long as his appointing governor is in power. \"Cause\" with regard to banks is difficult of proof since the public or the depositor has practically no access to the internal affairs of the bank. Are there not organizations in this community who are interested in seeing this legislation receive its proper review before it is passed? Edward J. Falkenstein Case School of Applied Science. ",

Binnell, in The Press of Feb. 16, suggests that the people write to their representatives in Washington telling them that the nation is not in favor of inflation because the country would suffer enormous losses on account of it.\n\nThe language used by Mr. Binnell is confusing and consequently his aim unintelligible. The \"nation\" as a whole, for instance, could not suffer from inflation, but only a class could suffer, namely the creditor class. He also uses the term \"people.\" In view of the fact that most of the people belong to the debtor class, having in mind that less than 10 per cent of the people own more than 90 per cent of the wealth, I do not see how inflation could harm the majority but that on the contrary they would benefit.\n\nIf Mr. Binnell is a democrat, using the expression in the doctrinal and not in a party sense, and he accordingly believes in the greatest good of the largest number, I do not see how he can logically oppose inflation but that on the other hand he must favor it.

A still greater service would be to empjoy someone to arrange the city's territory in the required number of wards and precincts and then ask the politicians to show cause why such division should not be accepted by Council. The sensible way to go about it would be to build up precincts and wards from the census tracts as shown in the large map accompanying Green's analysis of the data published by the Census Bureau. These tracts are small and compact and their population in 1930 is definitely known. H. D. ",

There is no doubt that the railroads are in a precarious condition, but what help, they received went to the bankers and insurance companies to help pay off their indebtedness, but it did not start the railroads carrying more goods or help them any in passenger traffic, so far the R.
