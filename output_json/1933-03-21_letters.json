Widely held beliefs tend to come true even though they defy logic. If everyone believes that a bank is going to fall, the chances are that it will fall. Conversely, if everyone believes that the bank will pull through, the chances are that it will pull through. On the national scale, there are no physical obstacles to an abundant life for everyone. The obstacles are purely mental. Starving because of overproduction, or freezing on top of mountains of coal, going to jail without benefit of counsel, or dying without solace of medicine (while doctors and lawyers complain about overcrowded professions), life's supreme handicap is always in the realm of ideas. I can visualize nothing better in the direction of human affairs until a new set of ideas has been built into the minds of men. Frank McKee. ",

In England they have experienced a great depression for several years, have gone off the gold standard and yet more banks closed their doors in the state of Ohio in the past month than in England during 50 years. If the bankers in this country had devoted their energies to the ethics of sound banking instead of bucket-shop speculating we would not be in the most deplorable condition we find ourselves in today. There should be enacted at once some very stringent laws regulating the manner in which a bank may handle the funds of its depositors. Faith in banks as a safe depository has been terribly shattered and it will take years to restore the confidence of the public. Hillingdon.\n\nbe",

    "text": "FREE SPEECH IN THE LEGION\n\n To The Editor of The Press. The Army & Navy Post of the American Legion has been served with an ultimatum from the officials of the American Legion that it either repudiate the action of its executive committee in recommending the passage of the economy bill, sponsored by President Roosevelt, or suffer ejection from the legion. This information was contained in your paper of March 16th and in a statement sent by the adjutant of this post to all of its members. The American Legion is not and cannot function as a military machine. It may be that a member of a military organization in war times should obey without hesitancy or criticism any order given by a superior officer. No organization, however, operating in peace time in a democratic government whose constitution guarantees the right of free speech, can survive if it attempts to exercise such autocratic control of enforcement of gag rule. The economy bill was, as I understand it, introduced in the federal Congress at the request of the president of this country and certainly ho organization can be permitted by public opinion to eject members from its roster becanse of the fact that they or their representatives express an opinion upon such a bill, particularly one in favor of its adoption. The question as to whether or not the government should pay or should ever have made payments relating to disabilities having no connection with war-time service is one on which any citizen should be free to express his frank opinion. It is my recollection from an article by Alfred E. Smith in the Saturday Evening Post that not only isolated posts of the legion but in fact the New England department of the legion took an attitude of opposition toward a great deal of the veterans' legislation.\n\nI am writing this to you as a member of Army & Navy Post and in the belief that it is high time that public opinion of this and other communities bring the officials charged with the conduct of the legion affairs to their 'sens\u00e9s. and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx military machine operating in war time with czaristic powers including that of gag rule. The legion as such is an extremely worthwhile American institutioil Dut it is very apparent its officials are departing wholly from the spirit of its constitution and from all standards of American conduct.
