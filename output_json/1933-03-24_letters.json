    "summary": "Rep. Kingsley Taft explains his opposition to the Senate amendment to the Ward bill. He argues that the amendment seeks to reduce the percentage of voter approval required for bonds on self-liquidating projects like municipally owned utilities. Taft believes the constitutional provision allowing such bonds already protects taxpayers by transferring business risk to bond buyers, thus nullifying the need for a lower approval threshold.",

    "text": "REP. KINGSLEY TAFT EXPLAINS VOTE ON WARD BILL\n\n Letters to the Editor\n\nTo the Editor of The Press: One of your editorials of March 22 refers to my action, in opposing approval of the Senate amendment to the Ward bill, as a mistake. I greatly respect the opinions expressed by your newspaper, but this is one instance in which my views as to the best interests of the people whom I represent differ from yours.\n\nUnder the law as it now exists, where bonds are to be issued for the construction of a municipal light plant, bridge or other improvement by a political subdivision of the state, 60 per cent of the voters must vote in favor of a tax levy required for the payment of interest and principal on such bonds. (Assuming, as is usually the case, no, levy within the 15-mill limitation is possible.)\n\nThe Ward Bill changes this 60 per cent to 65 per cent. Its purpose is the laudable one of requiring a greater percentage of voters to approve the issuance of bonds which would increase taxes.\n\nThe Senate amendment purported to reduce the 60 per cent of the present law and the 65 per cent of the Ward bill to only 55 per cent where the proposed improvements were \"municipally owned water, electric or gas works, systems or services, or transportation routes or systems.\"\n\nYour newspaper is of the opinion that this raises an issue between the people who want a bigger municipal light plant in Cleveland and the utilities. I do not believe such an issue is raised, but I believe that the issue raised is one between the people who pay taxes and those politicians who want to spend them on municipal water, electric and gas works and municipal street railroads.\n\nIt would clearly be wrong if the Ward bill, or the present law, required any vote of the people when bonds were to be issued for the construction or expansion of a sound municipal public utility.\n\nNothing in the present law or the Ward bill affects the Ohio constitution which provides for the issuance of mortgage bonds for the expansion or construction of municipally owned public utilities. Article 18, Section 12 of the constitution provides:\n\n\"Any municipality which acquires, constructs or extends any public utility and desires to raise money for such purposes may issue mortgage bonds therefor beyond the general limit of bonded indebtedness prescribed by law; provided that such mortgage bonds issued beyond the general limit of bonded indebtedness prescribed by law shall not impose any liability upon such municipality but shall be secured only upon the property and revenues of such public utility, including a franchise stating the terms upon which, in case of foreclosure, the purchaser may operate the same, which franchise shall in no case extend for a longer period of 20 years from the date of the sale of such utility and franchise on foreclosure.\" (Adopted Sept. 3.. 1912.)\n\nOnly one argument has ever been suggested to me by the proponents of the Senate amendment in answer to my claim that their amendment was not necessary in view of this constitutional provision. The argument is that a slightly higher rate of interest would have to be paid on mortgagebonds issued under the constitution than on bonds for the payment of which the credit of the municipality was pledged. Of course, as proponents of the Senate amendment admit, the reason for the lower rate of interest on bonds issued on the credit of the municipality, would be the assumption by the taxpayers of the substantial business risk involved. In the case of mortgage bonds issued under the constitution, that business risk would be asumed by the buyers of the bonds. It was argued in favor of the Senate amendment to the Ward bill that the improvements referred to in it were of a self-liquidating nature, so that the issuance of bonds for such improvements would not increase taxes. If a particular project were clearly self-liquidating so that it involved no substantial business risk, it should be easier to get voters to support it. Furthermore, if such business risk were absent, mortgage bonds issued under the contitution should sell at as low or a lower rate of interest than bonds secured only by the credit of the municipality. All so-called self-liquidating projects do not liquidate themselves. We have a very good example of that in the case of our Municipal Stadium which will not pay for itself, as had been supposed, but will be paid for by the taxpayers. Municipal light plants and other improvements covered by the Senate amendment can be financed by mortgage bonds issued under the constitution if there is not too great a business risk. If there is too great a business risk then the taxpayer 'should be protected from the imposition of that risk on him. The present law and the Ward bill both do that. Kingsley A. Taft. ",

    "summary": "The author disputes the notion that Mayor Miller saved the city money by purchasing the Cleveland Provision property instead of the Bassichis property, arguing that the actual costs are higher for the Cleveland Provision site due to additional expenses like building a garage and utilizing salvage material from existing structures.",

    "text": "SOME GARBAGE PLANT MATHEMATICS\n\nTo the Editor of The Press: The Cleveland Provision property, at 40 cents per square foot, for the proposed incinerator plant is, without doubt, a good buy for the city, nothwithstanding the fact that the Real Estate Board appraised same at 25 cents per square foot. What makes this property a good buy, other than the fact that the value is there, is the fact that the Cleveland Provision Co. is not making any profit on the transaction, and is, no doubt, taking a considerable loss. The Bassichis property, a stone's throw away, was almost bought for $63,000 several months ago, and then turned down by Mayor Miller after it was discovered that Bassichis was making a profit. On the face of it, it looks like Mayor Miller has saved the taxpayers of Cleveland the dif ference between $63,000 and $40,000, or $23,000, which we admit is not bad. But did we tell you that the Bassichis parcel had 130,000 square feet in it, and at the same rate of 40 cents per square foot would have a value of $52,000; and did we tell you the Bassichis parcel has a one-story garage building on it containing 30,000 square feet, which the city was to use as their truck garage, and that this building will now have to be built on the Cleveland Provision site at a cost of not less than $75,000; and did we tell you that the Bassichis parcel has on it 125.000 square feet of additional brick buildings which can be wrecked and the material used in the construction of the 'incinerator plant at a savings of at least $15,000 more. So let us see just how much this $40,000 property, which consists of all vacant land, is really costing the city:\n\nAgreed purchase price. $40.000 Garage (to be built).. 75.000 Salvage material . 15,000 Total cost of Cleveland Provision property. $130.000. The Bassichis parcel would have cost the city $63,000, which includes a $75,000 garage building, $15,000 worth of salvage material and an additional 30,000 square feet of land. Sounds to us like Miller-Mathics-whatever that is. William M. Bassichis. ",

    "text": "NO POLITICS IN BEER!\n\n To the Editor of The Press: It is a fact, and every clear-minded citizen will admit, that the present public officials from the president down to the smallest officeholder were elected on the one and only issue then paramount, namely the repeal of the 18th amendment. This is a fact that is true and cannot be denied. This, of course, was included in the new deal promised by the president, and no amount of praise is sufficient in giving thanks to Mr. Roosevelt for his prompt and forceful action in bringing this question to the front. But thanks to our muddle-headed local officials, we are not as yet out of the mire. It is evident, if reports are true, that our so-called local guardians are about to use this important victory for their own means, by slapping taxes on it right and left, and if the latest reports are true, and such legislation passes, it will be nigh impossible for a regular licensed dealer to compete with the bootlegger; for bootleggers there will be as long as there will not be a profit in it when sold in a legitimate way. The racketeers we have had with us so long will appear as pikers compared to our local fathers if this beer business is allowed to be used as a political foot-ball. Charles J.
