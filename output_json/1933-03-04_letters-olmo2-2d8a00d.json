I am sure you do not realize how-disasterous it would be to business to have a law to limit the withdrawal of commercial accounts, even temporarily. It is the working cash of all business, and the one thing that should be free today. Every man's credit is strained to the-limit. He must take advantage of all discounts, etc., to make ends meet. The banks charge a service fee for carrying these accounts, and therefore have no claim on them, and are liable for their payment on demand. Those funds are not for investment. With such a law they can ruin a man's credit and control any business at their discretion.

With money borrowed from them on personal security, he erates of interest and large bonus, spaying regular commercial 'rates to them, for our saving deposits drawing 3 per cent for security.

This ocasi\u00f3n calls for calm and clear thinking, but not for uncomplaining acceptance of such conditions. And it is time for all good citizens to protect the general interest, by holding them to sound business principles. Stand back of them in their troubles now, but pr\u00e9pare for the future.
