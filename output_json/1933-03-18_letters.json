    "summary": "The author expresses frustration over the advice given by certain women advisors that husbands should continuously court their wives with acts such as sending flowers, taking them to shows, and maintaining a perpetual honeymoon-like relationship. The author argues that while husbands are expected to do these things, the expectation is not reciprocal. He believes that wives should also make an effort to show appreciation towards their husbands, citing that they often have more economic freedom and opportunities than men. The letter points out the irony that while women have gained many rights, including voting and access to speakeasies and shows, they do not seem to reciprocate these efforts in relationships. It concludes with a warning to these advisors to rethink their expectations or risk upsetting the balance of marriage.",

But it never is. Most of these advisers are women. That's why they keep talking that way. A guy gets good and tired of doing that sort of thing and getting nothing in return.\n\nHow about the wives buying their husbands flowers once in a while, and inviting them to shows out of their own money? A husband would fall over dead if his wife did that. Why aren't wives supposed to be nice to their husbands as well as vice versa?\n\nThe fact is the wife has got more a' stake than the husband. He's supporting her, isn't he? I think it's up to her to be more particular about keeping their wedded bliss all one long honeymoon than him. The trouble is that all these advisers seem to think that a woman is doing a man a big favor when she marries him. How about him doing her one too? She gets just as much fun out of the honeymoon as he does. If she's doing him a favor so is he doing her one. It's fifty-fifty.\n\nAnd now that women have the vote, the run of the speakeasies, and all the economic freedom and sex liberties a man ever had, why don't they act like it?\n\nNow me, I'm not asking anything for myself. It's just the principle of the thing. I'd like it a lot if the little woman ever brought me a bunch of flowers, or said she had bought tickets for a good show for us. But no. And that isn't saying that a lot of girls are anxious to do those things for me, even if there are a few who might.\n\nAll I've got to say is a lot of these here wives better start thinking about what's sauce for the goose etc., because husbands aren't going to put up with such a one-way proposition much longer. At least one I know isn't.\n\nSo you tell those advisers to watch their step or their woman racket is going all Haywire on them one of these fine days, Spring is coming and you know about a young man's \"fancy.\" Mr. Ordinary Hubby.

    "summary": "The author, Herbert W. Hintz, proposes an alternative approach to taxation for local businesses that sell products not related to their primary business operation.

    "text": "A DIFFERENT KIND OF LICENSE TAX\n\n To the Editor of The Press: Attention: Louis Petrash and the members of the City Council. As a service station operator it would be very easy to condemn the proposed new tax on local business. However, I know that you have the interest of the city and its future at heart and that you hesitate to impose new burdens on business even in the face of a serious lack of city funds: Neither the citizens or the City Council would want to put a brake on any business already established here or drive any firms out of the city, therefore, let me propose for your consideration an alternative for your proposed tax measure. A sales tax or license-tax all business houses that sell in conjunction with their main line of business, completely dissimilar or non-related lines; for instance, last summer we sold soft drinks at our service station. Now our business is gasoline and oil sales. So, therefore, if we want a license to sell soft drinks, say, tax us $25 for the privilege. Now if a drug store wants to sell items that are not drugs let them pay a tax for the privilege, or if chain grocery stores want to sell motor oil let them sell it, but license them for the privilege. The same to hold with hardware stores, department stores, opticians, jewelers, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx will be no additional burden on business as long as they stay in their respective lines. Help eliminate de-structive price cutting, and the tax will be paid by those companies who have the extra capital to carry on business other than their own.\n\nI do not think that any of us want or desire more taxation, how-ever, if we indicate that we think the other fellow's business is so profitable and we want to share it, let us be willing to pay a tax to do it. Herbert W. Hintz. ",
