This proposal is aimed at reducing overhead costs for saloon owners by eliminating the need for storage space and pumps, and suggests an installation that includes a metered service with monthly billing.",

    "text": "WOULD SUBSTITUTE PIPE LINE FOR KEGS AND BOTTLES\n\n To the Editor of The Press: Such devices as kegs and bottles may have done justice to the beer industry of yesterday, but today they suggest something akin to the generator crank of the old telephone. Our new \"suds\" should be piped. Copper-lined tubing could run from the storage vats of the brewery through pumping stations located at strategic spots in its district. The beer would get into the barroom through a meter, be cooled in the ice-coil and run out of the spigot into the tankards, neat as you please. Any saloon proprietor need only outfit his oasis with bar, rail, mugs, cooler, spigot, sawdust and Rops art work-no pumps, store rooms, and other non-productive overhead. The beer technician comes around with the meter, collects a fee, turns on the flow and sends a bill every month. Maybe a quarter-meter could-be worked out for home use. To meet immediate demands breweries might lease city water mains from noon to 5 a. m. and run their lager through the channels using present meters. Beer for baths and shaving might be found novel if not entirely logical. You wouldn't need any soap-suds would be furnished. Jack Gilroy. ",

The writer wonders whether this is an honest attempt to economize or just a thinly veiled effort to throw business to the \"private, fee-collecting employment agencies\" that exist on the misfortune of the unemployed.

Fr. Charles E. Coughlin. It has been a source of irritation and constant wonder to me and to many others as to the reason for the silence, which has been obvious, of the nation's news journals regarding the Rev. Fr. Coughlin. Should the answer for this be control by reactionary capitalistic interests? A newspaper's first duty is to its readers and the ethics of the profession would never allow a continuance of a policy of disregarding one of the country's leading figures of interest and of his noble battle for human rights. Therefore, I am heartily glad to be able to feel that The Cleveland Press by this latest action cannot be classified in any such diabolical category, and that it is upholding the finest traditions of the Scripps-Howard Newspapers, an institution which has always prided itself on being liberal and has always advanced progressive thought. May it always continue to do so. J. Coleman 885 E. 128th street. ",

    "summary": "The author advocates for the government to manage savings through postal banks, investing them in mortgages and farms to ensure citizens' hard-earned money is safe and to stabilize the economy. Suggests this would eliminate the need for government bonuses, fat dividends, and low-interest loans to influential figures. The proposal would also discourage hoarding of money and prevent foreclosures by enabling mortgage moratoriums when needed.",

    "text": "\"THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE BANKER\n\n To the Editor of The Press: The banking stampede has demonstrated that the handling of time deposits is a natural government monopoly.\n\nDuring the era of large profits and plentiful dividends the banking fraternity protested loudly against governmental supervision and regulation.\n\nNow, however, they are shouting even more loudly for governmentalhelp to extricate them from the mire of their own troubles. The savings acumulated, by millions of our citizens as a defense against economic insecurity have in almost all instances been won at the price of a lifetime of toil and thrift. These savings are entitled to the greatest safeguards that our government can throw about them. I therefore wish to make the following suggestions: I suggest that our Postal Savings banks be so expanded that they accept time deposits in unlimited amounts and that these deposits be invested in first mortgages on homes occupied by their owners and farms operated by their owners. The present 2 per cent interest rate paid to depositors would be continued, of course, as they would be primarily interested in safeguarding their funds. Those who seek larger returns could patronize private savings banks. The government is under no necessity of paying huge bonuses to officers or making large loans to influential directors. It would be under no pressure to pay fat dividends to stockholders regardless of earnings. It could therefore limit its interest charges on these loans to 3 or 3\u00bd per cent. This would guarantee deposits of those who sought safety and reduce hoarding considerably. It would prevent recurring epidemics of foreclosures, as the government being the mortgagee, could at will declare temporary moratoriums. There would be no cost to the taxpayers, as the interest rates could be adjusted to make the project selfsupporting. Last, but not least, it would drive the \"money changers\" out of a substantial part of the \"temple\" and fear out of the hearts of depositors. Arthur A. Miller. ",
