    "summary": "The letter expresses concern over legislative delegation of power to the executive branch, citing the insurance superintendent's rule-making authority as an example. The author argues that such measures could lead to abuses and disregards by businesses. It brings up the contradiction in demands for constitutional adherence while supporting actions that potentially undermine it.",

    "text": "MR. BYERS SEES DANGER IN TOO MUCH AUTHORITY\n\nLetters to the Editor To the Editor of The Press: In this period when legislative bodies, unable to act for themselves, seem inclined to abdicate their constitutional powers at the behest of the executive branches of the government, it will be well for the people to bear in mind that out of such a situation may grow abuses far worse than the ills they are intended to remedy.\n\nIn the measures sought by President Roosevelt there is at least an appearance of delegation of constitutional power, in the bill enacted at a midnight session of our own Legislature attempting to grant plenary powers to the superintendent of insurance to control the insurance business in exercise of his absolute discretion (subject only to approval by the director of commerce), we have a measure which, if it were to be upheld by the courts, which God forbid, might serve as a precedent for legislation granting to governmental departments arbitrary control of every activity which could be said to be tinged with a public interest.\n\nIn granting to the president the power given him to control the banks, there are two saving considerations.\n\nHe is an elective, official. If he abuses his power he is accountable to the people and he might be impeached for such abuse. Moreover, it is fairly apparent that the bankers are not telling him what to do.\n\nThe superintendent of insurance is a political appointee. In our history usually he knows little or nothing about the insurance business when he takes office, and sometimes not much thereafter. Almost invariably he is a lawyer who is found connected with the insurance business when he goes out of office. The rules he makes will be and must be rules which the insurance companies want, for if the federal or state constitutions are still in effect, it is reasonably plain that the Legislature cannot itself make any law impairing the obligations of contracts, much less delegate that power to a mere superintendent of insurance.\n\nIt follows that such rules as he might make which were unlawful would be disregarded by the companies which were opposed to them. Where are the 400 percenters who were so vociferous only a short time ago in demanding that we all \"stand by the Constitution?\" E.-S. Byers. ",

If to revaluate our gold dollar or ounce would bring on confusion in foreign exchange and international trade we certainly would have received some effect when that little trick was pulled over in Europe.\n\nFrance discounted her national debt five times. It once was 80 billion, it now represents 16 billion in modern American money. This was all brought about by the revaluation of her gold dollar.\n\nWhen our gold dollar is revaluated this depression will look like a piker to any other hard times we have ever experienced. I would not be surprised if our new president takes similar steps as did France and other nations.\n\nJohn J. Henry 2117 W. 33d street. ",

    "text": "STANDS FOR REVALUATION\n\n To the Editor of The Press: John McCarthy in a letter printed in this column on March 8 says that revaluating gold would be foolish. The confusion in foreign exchange would be a mighty small detail as all exchanges are keyed to ever-changing prices as it is.\n\nThe confuston in international trade would certainly benefit you, Mr. McCarthy, as then, a foreign country could not manufacture an article to sell for a dime in their money containing 10 per cent gold, ship it thousands of miles, pay a tariff, and then undersell an Ameri-can-made product for a dime of ours  containing 40 per cent gold. Get the point?\n\nIf I take a thousand dollars from the bank, who will not lend it because of over-inflation of credit, and stick it in an old sock, would you call that ar increase in currency? Hardly, it is still the same old amount, Just a different hiding place.\n\nRevaluating gold would enable a man-most everybody who bought a home or a farm during the years of prosperity-which means really, years of cheap dollars, repay his debt under the same conditions that he contracted. Then the hidden source of supply for that well, to which you liken a bank, will once more start its life-giving flow, and cause the liquidation of its assets which are mostly real estate, thereby putting banks on a sound basis.\n\nWhich is best, Mr. McCarthy, $2.50 a day (when you work) and a $1500 debt and 40c wheat for a farmer who couldn't buy the things you make, or $5 a day and a $1500 debt with a farmer able to buy the things you make?
