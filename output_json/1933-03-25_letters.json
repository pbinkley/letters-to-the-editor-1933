    "text": "WILLIAM HENSE PAINTS MAYOR MILLER'S FAMILY TREE\n\nLetters to the Editor-\n\nTo the Editor of The Press: The part Mayor Ray T. Miller played at the St. Patrick dinner gave vent to the assertion that his ancestors came from Ireland. To terminate the speculation I did a little investigating and found that he is neither of this origin noras was also claimed-of Holland Dutch or Bohemian extraction, but that he is originally a German that is German as the grandson of a German immigrant could be under the circumstances. His mother is of pure Irish stock.\n\nThe grandfather was Joachim Mueller of Defiance, who came to Ohio in the year 1850. Before his emigration he lived in the village of Moellenbeck near Grabow in Mecklenberg-Shwerin.\n\nPoverty was the general lot of the rural Germans in those days, and the Mueller family fortune was not exceptional. Joachim Juergen Mueller had married Dorothea Elizabetn Krueger and was struggling to main-tain his young wife and two children. Many Germans were emigrating to America at that time. The emigration after the revolution of 1848 was the biggest of the century. So Mueller joined the throng of emigrants and settled in Defiance, where the original Mueller-American homestead still stands.\n\nIn America. Mueller, a sturdy and energetic man, prospered beyond anything he might have hoped for in the fatherland. He became a lumber dealer and teaming contractor of parts.\n\nFour more children were born, one of whom was Martin Edward Mueller who in turn became the father of the mayor.\n\nMartin Edward grew up in Defiance and married Ann Riley, an Irish girl, who is identified today as the handsome gray-haired woman, seen frequently with the mayor and Mrs. Miller-the mayor's mother. The old German family name, had, however, changed to the English \"Miller,\" long before the mayor's father left the paternal roof to found a home of his own. And thereby hangs a tale.\n\nJoachim Juergen Mueller's business was growing in the years when picneer communication and transportation in Ohio was being developed by the old canals. The elder Mueller needed a boat to navigate the canal between Toledo and Cincinnati, and hired a ship-building contractor to build her.\n\nThe contractor turned out to be an excellent ship builder but a pretty poor speller.\n\nOn the day the new boat was scheduled to make her first voyage, it was discovered that she had to have a name.\n\n\"Name her Joachim,\" the owner said. \"That's my Christian name.\" \"Joachim,\" the contractor mused, \"what's that?\" He had never heard the name nor did he know how to spell it.\n\nLeft to his own devices, and his employer not being handy to be consulted, the contractor just printed \"J. Miller\" on the boat's prow. The ship's papers had to be made out and signed by the proprietor whose name was allegedly on the prow.\n\nThe. Mueller business under the English name very soon became known as \"J. Miller,\" and Mueller, being a practical man as well as a staunch German, let it go at that. little dreaming that the incident of the shipbuilder's bad orthography would someday be retold when a grandson became mayor of Ohio's largest city.\n\nWilliam Hense.

But it is a chal-lenge of the recently propounded idea that respect for mothers is just another \"sentimental slush.\"\n\nWe attach sentiment in the making of great men and women. We honor great men and women for xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx order to induce others to strive for the same high ideal\n\nNow, why are some people against respect and honor of good mothers is a puzzle to me. Don't we need good mothers? If so, why not encourage them in this difficult job just as we do in case of great statesmanship or scientific pursuits of high standing.\n\nYes, some bad mothers take advantage of it for their selfish purposes; but so do some other unscrupulous men and women in other fields of human activities. These are comparatively very few and it is almost impossible to eradicate them altogether.\n\nThe time may come when the state will take care of children and we shall not need especially good mothers. But at the present and for a long time to come yet we must help every mother to become a really good mother. For general happiness' sake let us give credit to all good mothers!
