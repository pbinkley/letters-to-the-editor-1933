    "text": "SUGGESTS COMMERCIAL SCRIP TO AID BUSINESS\n\n-Letters to the Editor-\n\nTo the Editor of The Press: Inasmuch as those banks which have restricted withdrawals did not see fit to make an exception of commercial accounts which are the life of trade, perhaps this suggestion may furnish an expedient substitute. If the owner of a commercial account will write a check for $10 to the order of cash and take it to his bank, and if the bank will place a stamp thereon, indorsed, \"The Maker of This Check Has Not Issued Checks Like This in a Greater Amount Than His Commercial Deposit in This Bank,\" said check can then be used as scrip in the purchase of any commodity of the payment of any bill to anyone who will be willing to accept same in absolute payment of an obligation of $10. If this practice becomes universal, a new form of currency or commercial barter will have created itself without almost any mechanics. By the time the check has been used a dozen times, we can hope the present situation will have been so relieved, that the bank will be in a position to honor the payment of the check. With the indorsement as suggested, it is the same as a certified check, except that the bank is under no compulsion to honor payment, but by its indorsement furnishes a prospective taker with the information that the maker of the check has sufficient funds in nis commercial account, but obviously must a wait its withdraw until the bank voluntarily lifts the restriction or is in such a position that it can and must do so. Large bills can be paid to creditors, who are willing, by the required number or as many checks of $10 as such creditor may be willing to take. In other words such a check would act as a $10, bill... If the worstcomes to worst the creditor will have one or more $10 checks on his hands, depending on the number such creditor is willing to carry at one time. In the meantime, regardless of its ultimate value, the check has served as a medium of exchange. It will also make liquid the stagnant account. A $10 bill has, of course, gold behind it. The check will have $10 behind it but in additiori, the uncertainty of exchange payment in legal tender. For most part this mv well be disregarded in the face of the advantages and compensations attached thereto, Checks could be written in larger amounts, but they would not pass as easily. Under this plan some schemes might be suggested which might work a fraud. The prabability is that such practices would not be any different than those perpetrated in normal times without the present restrictions. Our present laws would be sufficient to take care of such. A party could not issue checks in a greater amount than his commercial deposits, otherwise the foregoing indorsement could not be secured from the bank. If the banks are willing to cooperate in this plan and permit savings accounts to be converted into checking, there is no reason why considerable hardship cannot be eliminated and the banks' depositors will have much to be thankful. for.

    "summary": "The letter's author, Fred W. Rose, commends Governor White's stance on opposing the repeal of state enforcement laws prior to ratification. He argues that the 'wets' in the Assembly do not have a mandate to hold such a vote, as it would prevent voters from considering the effects of repeal calmly. Rose believes this would only intensify lawlessness and exposes the wets' true intentions, which are contrary to temperance and law and order. He further criticizes The Press for its perceived bias against temperance, particularly on the day set aside for such instruction in schools. Rose suggests that a few years of unregulated alcohol consumption might be necessary to make 'wets' reconsider and call for stricter control than ever before attempted.",

    "text": "CENSURE FOR WETS\n\n To the Editor of The Press: Gov. White is to be commended for his stand in opposition to the repeal of state enforcement laws prior to ratification of the repeal amendment. However much the wets in the Assembly think they have a mandate to provide for such a vote, present dissatisfaction with the status quo everywhere would prevent the voters calm consideration of the results of such action and repeal would mean only the intensification of present conditions of lawlessness which they pretend to deplore. This certainly shows up most of the wets in their true light, not as advocates of temperance, but in their lust for drink real enemies of law and order.\n\nAs to the ratification of said amendment there seems to be little doubt at present, as wets are determined to put every obstacle in the way of enforcement so that even sincere drys will be forced to accept their proposals.\n\nYour paper deserves, censure by all right-thinking people for advocating such a course. The recent sneers in your news columns at temperance in the matter of strong drink being emphasized on the day set aside by the state for such teaching in our schools merely illustrates a case in point.\n\nAfter all, repeal may be what is needed to bring some short memoried wets back to their senses-a few years of free flowing booze and they may unite in calling for-more rigid control than was ever before attempted.

With the immense fall in price of silver and declining production of gold, which the League of Nations states will reach a crisis ins 1940, with the world loaded with debts payable in currency value of 1918, we are already beginning to hear of the demand for a new and more scientific basis for currencythat is a cheaper money to cause inflation for trade and make the payment of debt easier for the debtor. In a sense, Europe is today the new economic frontier of America.\"\n\nUnder President Hoover, who was considered the great engineer, we enacted tariff that almost staggered us with the prohibitive height to which duties were raised, in spite of the fact that we insisted upon collection from other nations of over $11,000,000:000 in loans, even the interest on which could only be paid by selling goods to us.\n\nWe know that there are no new gold fields to be discovered. First railroads in America were built by new supplies of gold found in Sacramento in 1849. Our agrarian empire which lies west of the Mississipi River and the boom of big business, manufacture and commerce on the eastern sea-coastal plan, were stimulated by Civil War plus gold fields discovered in the Rocky Mountains in 1864..\n\nUnparalleled orgy of stock market with its wild speculation ended in the disastrous collapse of 1929, because vast structure was built upon credit. It was the natural outcome of the great prosperity of big business, manufacture and commerce in our country.\n\nBranko M. Solich 903 E. 73d street. ",
