This would have meant that millions of dollars throughout the state would already have been made available to the government subdivisions of this state, and it wuold have meant that the bills would have in them some semblance of relief for the depositor, and not solely relief for the banker. Our relief agencies and government units today would not be in choas. Fred P. Soukup 702 Engineers Bldg. ",

With Mayor Miller proposing to utilize so much of the relief fund he hopes to obtain, for the employment of thousands in park improvement, the subject of parks becomes of greater importance than ever before.\n\nUnder the present setup the investment in parks will continue to be a political football with the public and their parks on the short end. The record of the handling of the parks for 20 years has been one of mishanagement, ignorarice and neglect. When we have had a sincere employee, he has been so dominated by the spoils system and political grandstanding that he has been unable to function. Under such conditions the use of additional funds in the parks, much as they are needed, will only add to political spoils.\n\nUnder the present setup thousands of the unemployed can be effectively employed in the parks, but If they are put to work faking up and burning every leaf and stray bit of organic material and we do not replace this natural fertilizer, the depreciation of the parks by the injury to trees and shrubs and permitting the erosion of the soil from the slopes will do irreparable damage. This is only one of the many ways in which our parks have been abused.\n\nYours for a square deal to the parks, to the persons whose generosity made them possible and to the public who supports them.

In all of these tests they have been tried, and at times severely so but never have been found wanting in that sensible, consistent type of moral courage which has returned them victorious on a thousand battlefields in almost every kind of contest.\n\nWithin recent days or weeks the citizens in this particular section of the nation, have been put to another serious and trying test. They -have suddenly and entirely without 1 warning, had their savings and even their checking accounts in their banking institutions tied up under severe restrictions thus making it extremely difficult and in many instances, entirely impossible for them to meet their current obligations. Checks which had been issued in good faith and accepted in the same manner, were returned marked \"restricted funds\" to the great embarrassment of all parties concerned. Withdrawal of cash deposits were limited to an almost negligible percentage or entirely eliminated through the expediency of \"bank holidays.\" Surely here was a real test coming as it did, after many weary discouraging months of business depression which had already -taxed the resources of every one almost beyond limit.\n\nDid these citizens give way to panic and despair? Did they consider violence or retallation? Did they resort to vigorous criticism or abuse? No, but they did promptly ask for an explanation of this action and upon being assured and convinced that it was a necessary move to protest individual entities and to insure a fair and equal distribution of available funds, they accepted the situation in the interest of the common good and are trying to forget their personal inconvenience. This faith, co-operation, courage and determination cannot be denied and must not be abused.\n\nB. O. Selple, superintendent State-City Employment Service.",
