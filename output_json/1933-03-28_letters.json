How can a nation expect to have continued prosperity, and fill its. proper place in the world, if it has to depend upon revenue from such a damnable business \u00e1s is the liquor business, to carry on its activities?\n\nYour editorial concerning beer for Ohio, on the first page of your March 25 issue, makes me so mad I am almost tempted to discontinue taking your publication. It seems to tell your readers you think the getting of beer is a major accomplishment, and a necessary thing in the plan to renew prosperity. May the great God look down with pity upon us if we have sunk so low that our prosperity and well being depends upon that cursed business. This letter will not change your opinion one lota, but I hope it will let you know we do not all think the legal return of that cursed demon is for the best interests of the land we love. W. E.

How far is it from placing collars of iron around the necks of 250,000 to 1,000,000 and so on? Examining further, the unemployment solution would take the form of indenturing (read enslaving) all the unemployed until there would be a standing \"pauper\" class working under prison or chattel slave-latifundia conditions and discipline. All the unemployed would eventually pass into \"prison\" camps. Taxes which now feed the R. F. C. and provide the disemployed some relief has already impoverished the middle classes which can stand no more. It becomes necessary to tax the capitalist class, but it is cheaper to pay the insignificant \"army\" sum of $30 a month than to provide direct relief; then the paupers could be put to work building up more raw material resources for the parasite class rather than be a non-productive liability on corporate wealth.

    "summary": "The author, J.M. Hill, who is a mining engineer with 38 years of experience, discusses the global economic crisis of the 1930s centered around the world's monetary gold reserve and debt obligations. He argues that the largest creditor nations are draining the gold reserves of debtor nations, leading to a cycle of poverty, unemployment, and under-consumption. Hill suggests a two-part solution: readjusting or canceling international monetary obligations and revaluing gold to at least $60 per ounce to alleviate the economic strain on debtor nations.",
    "doctype": "letter",
    "text": "ANOTHER REVALUATOR\n\n To the Editor of The Press: The monetary gold reserve of the world on Jan. 1, 1933, was $12,050,000,000. The total indebtedness of the world, that is, obligations payable in gold, amounts to $316,000,000,000. While these debt payments mature through a long succession of years there is not sufficient gold in reserve in the world to pay interest on the principal of the world's debts without completely draining the gold reserve of the debtor nations. At the rate of increase at which gold is going to monetary use a panic in monetary gold will continue. Thus, it is obvious that the largest creditor nations are going to continue to drain the gold reserves of the debtor nations, and force them to sell their products at any price obtainable in order to get the gold with which to meet their obligations.\n\nThe final results are loss and chaos to every nation in the world that is engaged in international comfierce. Wage and living standards will remain impoverished, unemployment will continue, agriculture will continue to suffer, and under-consumption will continue. The concentration of money will continue, which situation has proved disastrous to the common wealth of all nations, from the beginning of organized governments.\n\nThe questions arise as to what should be done to avoid further oppression of the debtor nations by the creditor nations and how to completely eradicate unemployment among all nations, thereby restoring happiness, prosperity, and the blessedness of good will among the whole of civilization. If my logic is correct, the plan to follow is this: 1: Readjust or cancel international monetary obligations. (a) It is as unreasonable for a nation to remain a creditor nation and also a competitor as it would be for a chain store monopoly to loan money to interests which operate in competition to the chain. (b)On account of our natural resources the United States cannot afford to remain a creditor nation. 2: Revaluate the troy ounce of gold to at least $60 per ounce 1000 fine.\n\nI have been a mining engineer for 38 years and have sampled and assisted in sampling gold bearing grounds from Nome, Alaska, to Yukon basin on the north to the Mexican border on the south and in Mexico for the Green Consolidated Mining Co. and know of what I write. We can get a revaluation of the troy ounce of gold only by sticking together and organizing clubs. J. M. Hill. ",
