    "summary": "The author, John McCarthy, opposes the revaluation of the gold dollar due to concerns about its effects on currency value and price levels in relation to international trade. He argues that while there has been an increase in currency during the depression, credit and circulation have decreased significantly. Therefore, adding more potential credit through gold revaluation would not lead to higher prices. Furthermore, he contends that the current bank stringency is merely a temporary issue of withdrawals exceeding deposits and can be rectified by adjusting withdrawal rates and allowing more deposits.",

    "text": "TO THE EDITOR OF THE PRESS:\n\nThe demand that the gold dollar be revalued is foolish. If we Americans were to revalue, without other nations doing likewise, the value of our currency in relation to the value of theirs would be dislocated; and the result would be confusion in foreign exchange and international trade.\n\nWith gold revalued our present stock of gold 'would serve as a basis for a greater quantity of currency: but currency has been increasing all through the depression-while prices have been dropping-so why assume that more currency would bring higher prices? Prices do not depend on currency alone, they depend also on the total amount of credit outstanding and on the rapidity with which both currency and credit circulate.\n\nWhile there has been an increase in. in currency, there has been a decrease a very big decrease in credit and circulation and so the three combined are much less now than in 1929; which is why prices are much lower.\n\nRevalued gold would provide more potential credit, but there was plenty of potential credit at the banks long after the depression started; but the business world didn't need it and couldn't use it. Had there been more, what good would it have been?\n\nGold revaluation would only bring confusion. It wouldn't help matters a particle. As for the present bank stringency, it simply means that for a considerable time withdrawals have been exceeding deposits. The bank's reserves have thus become a little low. It is precisely like drawing water out of a well faster than the water seeps in. We will have to draw less out for a while, and let more seep in. The situation is not really serious and it will steadily improve. John McCarthy 1730 W. 38th street. ",

This indicates to us that we human beings in the conduct of our lives must have a material foundation first if there is to be a spiritual development. True as it is that man cannot live by bread alone, precedence must be given bread. Without substance there is no room for spiritual growth.\n\nWhile during the last three years we have set the best minds of our country to thinking of how to bring the economical calamity to a close, consideration should not be withheld for the waves of crime which have spread over our country. If we are to survive economically we must make spiritual readjustment as well. Unless we do uphold our moralstandard we would not be able to avail ourselves of prosperity when it comes. We cannot put all the responsibility for our moral laxity upon the present day difficulties. Its origin must be sought in our broken homes, our nominally religious institutions that afford no spiritual training.\n\nFor countless generations men had struggled for freedom, willing to live and die for the right to worship and now in an age with that freedom attained, what does that freedom mean to us? We have become indifferent, we neither affirm nor deny religion. We think of God as one who is tolerated by us instead of thinking us tolerated by him. We pay our debt to him by coming once in a while or even once a year to church or temple, rolling presumptuously in munificence in luxuriant pews, appreciating the sensuous atmosphere with no relation to the love of God which is also the love and consideration of our fellowmen. It is real prayer and worship that prevents the infliction of pain in others and is able to check crime and vice and enable men to enjoy life to the fullest. Rabbi Jacob Richman, Lorain, O. ",

It was changed to Constantinople in honor of Constantine the Great, and recently the Turks have returned to the former name.\n\nThe above answer is obviously incorrect. Constantinople did not fall into the hands of the Ottoman Tarks until 1453 A. D., when the Eastern Roman Empire, so-called, came to an end. It is highly im-probable that it was given a Turkish name prior to that date. True, Istambul is the old Turkish name, but it is not the original. The city was first called after Constantine when that emperor established the eastern seat of Roman government at that point in 330 A. D.

However, even then the name Byzantium still clung and today we still speak of Byzantine language and Byzantine architecture,\n\nByzantium was settled sometime in the Sixth Century B.
