He has been in office for only a short length of time but has accomplished much and has gained the confidence of the people in this country. He was not afraid to state his ideas and plans and at the same time he succeeded in them.\n\nI listened to his radio talk Sunday, March 12, and I thought it was given in a very clear and concise manner. Subjects concerning banks were explained so simply that practically anyone could understand them. He has moved swiftly in his methods to clear up the banking system and at the same time has restored the confidence of the people in the banks. Once more we will be able to entrust our money in the banks without the constant fear of not being able to receive it back.\n\nThe president's wife has also shown a wonderful example to the country. She has been constantly by the side of her husband and has tried to aid him to the greatest possible extent.\n\nA great many of the people appreciate the things that are being accomplished by the president and are only too glad to co-operate with him. Here's hoping that he will be able to lead us out of this financial difficulty we have fallen into and show us the good and prosperous times again. Josephine Masar. ",

White: As a man who in the face of bitter opposition insisted that you as a candidate be accorded the same indorsement by the Cleveland Federation of Labor as your rival and af that time few, Democrats had the courage to do that in what was then a Republican stronghold, I am now writing you in behalf of the small home owners, believing them to be in need and deserving of clean-cut, businesslike aid, when the men and women of America are engaged in a bitter struggle with circumstances over which they are powerless, being against a stone wall of unemployment.\n\nHow far will you go in their behalf? Is there any possibility of a moratorium for those with a large equity, men and women who have proven their thrift and industry by years of regular payment, until the dykes gave way and this flood of unemployment swept all before it?\n\nMay I mention to you also the damnable injustice of Ohio's deficiency judgment, compared to other states, in a crisis like the present, in an emergency like the present. which is greater than that of war itself, recognized as such by Roosevelt-asking for and receiving wartime power under wartime act.\n\nThese are extraordinary times, and unless our executives meet them with extraordinary measures, the reaction to millions of home owners who are now wondering what possible meaning the word equity has to a home owner will be phenomenal and perhaps startling to the world. Already the Small Home Owners' Federation has had a wonderful growth, passing the 10,000 mark here in Cuyahoga county, although thumbed down by the Cleveland Federation of Labor, just as unemployment insurance was until I took the bull by the horns and appointed a the first committee. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx F with the farmers of the west mak-ing it an organization of far-reaching and ever-growing influence. With every confidence in your sincerity and desire to serve, I am writing you for a frank statement of what you can do for the home owners of Ohio.\n\nJohn McLellan Delegate to the Home Owners' Central Committee.

Any of the congressmen could easily be swayed and led and forced to follow the leader, when it was either that or lose the political plums they could get for their friends. But not so with Bob Crosser; he stood on his own initiative, plums or no plums, and voted his own convictions. That is what takes courage and backbone.

Who can deny that was a godlike act? Hence, \"for God.\" That great organization of yours-and mine-has a slogan, part of which reads, \"For God and Country, in Peace and in War.\" An excited reporter yelled, \"Who struck him down?
