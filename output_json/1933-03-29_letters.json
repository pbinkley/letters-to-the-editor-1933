    "summary": "The author, F. Von Falkenberg, is a former executive director of the Cuyahoga County Taxpayers' League. In this letter to the editor, he expresses his disapproval of certain real estate men and attorneys who have approached him with the proposition of helping them 'milk' taxpayers out of refunds by promising commissions or percentages. The league was formed by honest men to ensure the benefit of taxpayers without personal gain. Von Falkenberg considers such practices unethical and warns others not to use his name or the league's in this dubious scheme. He advises that the county auditor's office is always ready to assist taxpayers at no cost.",

    "text": "WILL NOT SOLICIT REFUNDS ON COMMISSION BASIS\n\nLetters to the Editor-\n\nTo the Editor of The Press: Certain real estate men and at-torneys have recently approached me on the subject of road refunds, according to a recent decision of the Ohio Supreme Court. As former executive director of the Cuyahoga County Taxpayers' League, it would appear that the aforesaid gentlemen would like to have my services in helping them milk the unfortunate taxpayer out of a few more dollars.\n\nThe proposition has been that because I have had extraordinary experience with regard to these matters, that I could \"co-operate\" with them in the very naive manner described by them as follows: That \"we\" could search out the taxpayers who have paid excessive amounts, approach these taxpayers with the promise of getting their refunds on some sort of a commisison or percentage basis.\n\nThe Cuyahoga County Taxpayers' League was formed by some of the best known and certainly some of the most honest men in the county. At their own expense they brought suit for these refunds solely and wholly for the benefit of the people. No one, with the exception of the aforesaid gentlemen, has had the slightest desire to make money on the already unfortunate plight of their fellow taxpayers.\n\nI personally consider such practice wholly unethical, to be polite, and downright dishonest in matter of fact. Because I feel that anyone who is so lacking in moral conception as to use this method of making a few dollars might also use my name of the name of the league in connection therewith, I offer this letter as a warning to all persons who may have refunds coming to them. The office of the county auditor has been established for years to take care of the legitimate needs of the taxpaying public and through my considerable association with this office, I know that the personnel thereof are always willing to help the taxpayer courteously and with no cost.

Two years ago John's company no longer needed his services, but, because of his good record with them, they told him they would not allow his family to starve. So every week they gave John a basket of groceries, ranging in value from $2.50 to $3.25, and in order to keep the stigma of charity from entering John's life, they have him work, a day or a day and a half (from eight to 12 hours) for the basket.\n\nJohn discovered that the basket of groceries would not feed eight persons-six of them growing children-so he applied to Associated Charities for additional food. But the A. C. tell John he has a job so they cannot give him help.\n\nNow if John received no groceries from his company, he would receive from the A. C. about twice as much food as he now receives. He is on the horns of a dilemma. Should he sever connections with his company and get his food from charity, or hang onto his place on the company payroll so that in the eventuality the company again hires men he will be in the strategic position? He looks back on the past two lean years with bitterness, and looks ahead with apprehension. Three dollars and twenty-five cents in groceries does not go far with eight people for a week's fare.
