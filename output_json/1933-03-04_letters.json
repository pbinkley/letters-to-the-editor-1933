The author, Walter Lee, argues against any law limiting the withdrawal of commercial accounts, stating that the working cash of businesses must remain free. He believes that such a law would allow banks to control businesses and ruin their credit at will. Lee also criticizes the banks for charging fees on deposits and not offering fair rates on loans, highlighting a breach of public trust. He calls for new laws to control banks instead of blindly supporting them.",

I am sure you do not realize how-disasterous it would be to business to have a law to limit the withdrawal of commercial accounts, even temporarily. It is the working cash of all business, and the one thing that should be free today. Every man's credit is strained to the-limit. He must take advantage of all discounts, etc., to make ends meet. The banks charge a service fee for carrying these accounts, and therefore have no claim on them, and are liable for their payment on demand. Those funds are not for investment. With such a law they can ruin a man's credit and control any business at their discretion.
