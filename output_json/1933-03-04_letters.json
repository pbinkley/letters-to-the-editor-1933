    "summary": "The author, Walter Lee, disputes the notion of supporting banks for general economic benefit by proposing a law to limit temporary withdrawals from commercial accounts. He argues that the money in these accounts is essential working capital for businesses and should remain accessible. He criticizes banks for charging fees while demanding payment on demand, and believes they should not control business through financial measures. The letter also hints at banks' unethical behavior by refusing loans on real estate and manipulating asset values. Lee concludes by calling for laws to control banks in the future and for citizens to protect their general interest by advocating for sound business practices.",

    "text": "FINDS US UNREASONABLE\n\n To the Editor of The Press: Your editorial, Back the Banks for the General Good, is the most unreasonable thing I have ever read in your paper in sometime. I am sure you do not realize how-disasterous it would be to business to have a law to limit the withdrawal of commercial accounts, even temporarily. It is the working cash of all business, and the one thing that should be free today. Every man's credit is strained to the-limit. He must take advantage of all discounts, etc., to make ends meet. The banks charge a service fee for carrying these accounts, and therefore have no claim on them, and are liable for their payment on demand. Those funds are not for investment. With such a law they can ruin a man's credit and control any business at their discretion. They refusing to loan on real estate, allowing the investor to juggle values until their assets in that line are destroyed. With money borrowed from them on personal security, he erates of interest and large bonus, spaying regular commercial 'rates to them, for our saving deposits drawing 3 per cent for security. They have Violated the conndence and trust of the public. It was a gamble, and they have lost. They should be held to account for it, by laws to control them hereafter. This ocasi\u00f3n calls for calm and clear thinking, but not for uncomplaining acceptance of such conditions. And it is time for all good citizens to protect the general interest, by holding them to sound business principles. Stand back of them in their troubles now, but pr\u00e9pare for the future. Yours for calm and clear thinking. Walter Lee 6214 Lexington avenue. ",
