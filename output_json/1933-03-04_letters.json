    "summary": "The letter's author, Walter Lee, expresses his discontent with the editorial 'Back the Banks for the General Good' from The Press newspaper. He argues against a proposed law that would limit the withdrawal of commercial accounts in banks. Lee believes that this law could ruin a business owner's credit and give banks too much control over business operations. He is particularly critical of banks charging service fees without providing adequate loan opportunities to businesses. Furthermore, he criticizes banks for their high-interest rates on personal loans and low-interest rates on savings deposits. Lee argues that banks have lost the trust of the public through such practices and calls for laws to control them in the future. He urges fellow citizens to protect the general interest by enforcing sound business principles.",

    "text": "FINDS US UNREASONABLE\n\n To the Editor of The Press: Your editorial, Back the Banks for the General Good, is the most unreasonable thing I have ever read in your paper in sometime. I am sure you do not realize how-disasterous it would be to business to have a law to limit the withdrawal of commercial accounts, even temporarily. It is the working cash of all business, and the one thing that should be free today. Every man's credit is strained to the-limit. He must take advantage of all discounts, etc., to make ends meet. The banks charge a service fee for carrying these accounts, and therefore have no claim on them, and are liable for their payment on demand. Those funds are not for investment. With such a law they can ruin a man's credit and control any business at their discretion. They refusing to loan on real estate, allowing the investor to juggle values until their assets in that line are destroyed. With money borrowed from them on personal security, he erates of interest and large bonus, spaying regular commercial 'rates to them, for our saving deposits drawing 3 per cent for security. They have Violated the conndence and trust of the public. It was a gamble, and they have lost. They should be held to account for it, by laws to control them hereafter. This ocasi\u00f3n calls for calm and clear thinking, but not for uncomplaining acceptance of such conditions. And it is time for all good citizens to protect the general interest, by holding them to sound business principles. Stand back of them in their troubles now, but pr\u00e9pare for the future. Yours for calm and clear thinking. Walter Lee 6214 Lexington avenue. ",
