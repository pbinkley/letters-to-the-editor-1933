    "summary": "The author contrasts Cincinnati's efficient and well-run city services with Cleveland's less effective manager form of government. They argue that Cincinnati's smaller council, better pay for officials, and quality of its citizens make it a more desirable place to live despite its smaller size compared to Cleveland. The letter mentions the library system, police and fire departments, waste collection, school system, and municipal university as strong points of Cincinnati's city services. The letter concludes with a statement about the long-term development of Cincinnati's citizenry based on quality rather than mere size.",

    "text": "HE LIKES CINCINNATI\n\n To the Editor of The Press! Your editorial about Cincinnati was very good except that you do not go far enough..\n\nAs a former Cincinnatian, and one who had a very small part in launching the present city government, think you could also have mentioned the following points. In spite of economical operation, Cincinnati has a police and fire department which will bear comparison with the best in the country. Their waste collection system is thorough and reliable, not the hit or miss proposition it is here. The school system is one of the best in the country, while the city maintains a municipal university which attracts students from all over the world.\n\nAll these services, besides many others of a more distinctive character, are provided for out of a tax rate considerably lower than that of Cleveland. Just to mention one of the distinctive Cincinnati projects. I recall an item in one of the papers recently mentioning the fact that the Cincinnati Public Library had the best collection of Braille books for the blind in the United States and that it was extensively used throughout the country.\n\nIn my judgment Cleveland doomed its manager form of government to failure from the start by the retention of the large, locally elected, council, poorly paid and therefore open to party manipulation. Cincinnati only has nine councilmen, elected at large and paid well enough to make them less susceptible to influence from selfishly motivated interests.\n\nBut the greatest difference, and one that only time can change is the fundamental difference in the electorate. This city, together with Detroit, Chicago and others is nowpaying the price for the senseless b -drive for mere size regardless of the quality of the people who made up the increase, It will take this city a generation and possibly two to s develope a citizenship averaging up with the third generation German, a Irish and northern Italian stock to which most Cincinnatians can trace their ancestry. I have no desire to minimize the good points of Cleveland which are humerous and real but as they stand at present Cleveland may be twice as big, but Cincinnati is twice as desirable a city in which to live.

    "text": "WANTS MORE CURRENCY\n\nTo the Editor of The Pres This bank limitation of 5 per cent on withdrawals that has just reached Cleveland reminds one of the recent statement made by Secretary Mills that the total bank deposits in the U; S. A. amounts to $46,000,000,000 and the actual cash in the U. S. A. amounts to less than $6,000,000,000. If our Congress would now print $40,000,000,000 in currency there would then be just enough money in the country to cover the bank deposits and if our government should print $40,000,000,000 on its own instead of the usual \"bank notes\" and loan the same to refinance farm and home loans at 2 per cent interest, the revenue to the government would almost balance the budget and, at the same time force down all interest rates to 2 per cent and thus save a difference in interest burden on the American people of 4 per cent average on the-200,000,000,000 total of interest bearing debts, or $8,000,000,000. This $8,000,000,000 a year saving to the people would automatically increase the buying power of the masses to that extent. It would do more to \"restore confidence\" and create prosperity than all the public works programs and beer tax programs and foreign trade programs all put together could do. Let's put Cleveland to work but not by inflating our deht structure with more bond issues. Our banker friends are hollering their heads off against \"inflation of currency,\" but you don't hear one of them saying a word about us having inflated our debts so much that just the interest now amounts to 4,000,000 a year more than our entire money supply. For us to try and run this country with less than $6,000,000,000 (plus bank credit confidence) is like trying to run a motor car with one pint of oil in the crank case.. C. B. Keenum, 2244 E.

He said that Hitler has become. H chancellor because Von Hindenburg is old and his days are numbered. Does the rabbi mean that 60,000,000 people in Germany are asleep that they allow this man to take advantage of them? Certainly Von Hindenburg cannot have lost control of his mind. In one breath he expresses .concern about the March 5 elections and that Hitler will drive the Jews from Germany and in the next, the rabbi likens Hitler to Mussolini How can he make such a comparison when it is common knowledge that in the years Mussolini has been in power, the Jews in Italy have received better treatment and more consideration than in any other country in the world. Should such a thing happen in Germany as the driving out of the Jews, an appeal can be made to Mussolini and the Pope and they will welcome the Jews to Italy. S G F He said that Germany, Italy, Austria and Hungary are banding together against France, Jugoslavia and Russia (with Poland on the c fence) and that there will soon be war. This is just a bad dream. Mussolini has been in power for more than 10 years and in spite of France's inuendos he has kept and is keeping peace. He has been on the fields of battle, wounded several times and he knows what war means.. Of course, it is evident that the rabbi is against Mussolini because he is a dictator. He does not telle his listeners of the good that Mussolini has done for Italy, bringing it to its rightful place as a sovereign nation. Think how much better off we would be were Roosevelt vested with the powers of a dictator. Then the kind of corruption in government we read about In Liberty magazine would be rectified.
