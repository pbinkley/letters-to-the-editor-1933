    "summary": "The author, Nina Grundman, appeals to the editor of The Press to support a campaign to preserve the library system in Cleveland, Ohio. She argues that in difficult economic times, the library is a crucial source of recreation and education for people like her husband who are unemployed. She points out that closing all but the main library would severely limit access to reading materials for those relying on branch libraries due to financial constraints. Additionally, she asserts that the library is essential to prevent insanity or socialist leanings among the population deprived of recreational resources. The letter ends by calling on The Press to use its influence to push state legislators to fund libraries appropriately through new tax revenues.",

It is even more necessary in these times than in good times.\n\nMy husband has been without a job for over two years and the library supplies us with books and music which are the only forms of recreation we have. We'd go insane (or Socialist) if we couldn't get reading material. Furthermore keeping only the main library open as has been suggested would not be doing much good because 66 per cent of the books circulated are through the branch libraries. The unemployed and the children who use the neighborhood libraries cannot spend 20 cents for carfare every time they need books.\n\nYou can spare lots of room in your pages for news of the beer bill, which is undoubtedly important, but there are a good many people in Cleveland who would rather have books than beer.\n\nYour paper makes public opinion and this move to make our Ohio legislators give the libraries of the state their fair share of the new tax in intangibles will be a success if The Press uses its influence and emphasizes the fact that the library has reached the end and must close in June if something is not done very soon.

    "summary": "The authors contest the arbitrary closure of Rocky River fishing by Mr. Stinchcomb, arguing that it discriminates against local fishermen, particularly those from Cleveland. They claim that the ruling, while well-intentioned, unfairly penalizes a group who have no direct influence over the condition of the river. They point out the lack of evidence supporting the idea that bass return to spawn where they were spawned and question why only certain streams are being closed when a more general approach would be understood if it was truly about conservation.",

    "text": "FISHERMEN PROTEST CLOSING OF RIVERS\n\n To the Editor of The Press: The writers of this letter to you represent thousands of fishermen, taxpayers and voters, who desire to bring forth another side of Mr. Stinchcomb's order closing Rocky River fishing.\n\nThis, to us, seems arbitrary and discriminatory. Regardless of the merits or demerits of spring fishing in general, it is a fact that the state of Ohio did riot make it illegal to fish until May 1. Mr. Stinchcomb's ruling represents his own personal opinion and perhaps that of some other fishermen who do not exactly understand the true conditions. We, who fish Rocky River particularly, are most seriously affected by this ruling.\n\nIt is an obvious fact that even if this stream were closed, it would be of no direct benefit to the Metropolitan Park system, or to the fishermen of Cleveland at large. It would rather be a benefit to those people outside Cleveland who own property bordering migratory streams flowing into Lake Erie. Migratory streams, as you know, are streams which fish use during the spawning season and from which, at the completion of spawning, they return whence they came. Rocky River is one of these streams, and the fish that use it are products of Lake Erie. At the close of the spawning season they return either to the islands or to similar reefs in the lake.\n\nRegarding the \"slaughter of fish\" to t which Mr. Stinchcomb refers, that e was due entirely to the faulty construction of the concrete ramp t across the river, which did not permit the fish to pass. Thanks to Mr. e Stinchcomb, this has been corrected, and the fish now have at least the same chance as they have in other rivers.\n\nThe idea, then, of not permitting Cleveland people to fish in their own public park in order to help the fishermen of Sandusky, Huron, Erie. Vermilion, etc., seems to us discriminatory, inasmuch as it has 1 yet to be proven that bass return to spawn where they themselves were spawned.\n\nIf it were a general thing throughout the state to close all streams to spring fishing, you would find us among the most willing to co-operate. Under the circumstances, however, we are naturally unwilling to be deprived of the sport which our own money helps to buy and maintain.\n\nYou doubtless know that property owners along the nearby migratory streams make a charge, usually 50 cents, for the privilege of fishing from their land. That is fine for those who have the 50 cents and the price of getting there, but how about those who don't have it? Why are they to be penalized by one man's well-meaning but futile gesture?
