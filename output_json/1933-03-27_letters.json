She explains how the lack of employment has made books and music through the library the primary form of recreation for her and others. The letter also points out that closing branch libraries would disproportionately affect the unemployed and children who rely on them due to cost constraints, and emphasizes the importance of saving all libraries, not just the main one.",

It is even more necessary in these times than in good times.\n\nMy husband has been without a job for over two years and the library supplies us with books and music which are the only forms of recreation we have. We'd go insane (or Socialist) if we couldn't get reading material. Furthermore keeping only the main library open as has been suggested would not be doing much good because 66 per cent of the books circulated are through the branch libraries. The unemployed and the children who use the neighborhood libraries cannot spend 20 cents for carfare every time they need books.\n\nYou can spare lots of room in your pages for news of the beer bill, which is undoubtedly important, but there are a good many people in Cleveland who would rather have books than beer.\n\nYour paper makes public opinion and this move to make our Ohio legislators give the libraries of the state their fair share of the new tax in intangibles will be a success if The Press uses its influence and emphasizes the fact that the library has reached the end and must close in June if something is not done very soon.

    "summary": "The authors question the unilateral decision by Mr. Stinchcomb to close Rocky River fishing, arguing that it is arbitrary, discriminatory, and contrary to established laws. They assert that the ruling negatively impacts local fishermen while providing no direct benefit to the park system or broader fishing community, as migratory fish return to Lake Erie after spawning.",

    "text": "FISHERMEN PROTEST CLOSING OF RIVERS\n\n To the Editor of The Press: The writers of this letter to you represent thousands of fishermen, taxpayers and voters, who desire to bring forth another side of Mr. Stinchcomb's order closing Rocky River fishing.\n\nThis, to us, seems arbitrary and discriminatory. Regardless of the merits or demerits of spring fishing in general, it is a fact that the state of Ohio did riot make it illegal to fish until May 1. Mr. Stinchcomb's ruling represents his own personal opinion and perhaps that of some other fishermen who do not exactly understand the true conditions. We, who fish Rocky River particularly, are most seriously affected by this ruling.\n\nIt is an obvious fact that even if this stream were closed, it would be of no direct benefit to the Metropolitan Park system, or to the fishermen of Cleveland at large. It would rather be a benefit to those people outside Cleveland who own property bordering migratory streams flowing into Lake Erie. Migratory streams, as you know, are streams which fish use during the spawning season and from which, at the completion of spawning, they return whence they came. Rocky River is one of these streams, and the fish that use it are products of Lake Erie. At the close of the spawning season they return either to the islands or to similar reefs in the lake.\n\nRegarding the \"slaughter of fish\" to t which Mr. Stinchcomb refers, that e was due entirely to the faulty construction of the concrete ramp t across the river, which did not permit the fish to pass. Thanks to Mr. e Stinchcomb, this has been corrected, and the fish now have at least the same chance as they have in other rivers.\n\nThe idea, then, of not permitting Cleveland people to fish in their own public park in order to help the fishermen of Sandusky, Huron, Erie. Vermilion, etc., seems to us discriminatory, inasmuch as it has 1 yet to be proven that bass return to spawn where they themselves were spawned.\n\nIf it were a general thing throughout the state to close all streams to spring fishing, you would find us among the most willing to co-operate. Under the circumstances, however, we are naturally unwilling to be deprived of the sport which our own money helps to buy and maintain.\n\nYou doubtless know that property owners along the nearby migratory streams make a charge, usually 50 cents, for the privilege of fishing from their land. That is fine for those who have the 50 cents and the price of getting there, but how about those who don't have it? Why are they to be penalized by one man's well-meaning but futile gesture?
