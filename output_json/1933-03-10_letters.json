    "summary": "The letter highlights a concern about the potential liquidation of irrevocable trust funds in the event of a bank failure. Mrs. Wesson points out that although many people believe their trust funds are secure and separate from the commercial deposits, existing laws allow for these trust funds to be treated as such during a crisis. This potentially exposes trustors to the same risks as ordinary depositors. The author calls for clarification and change in the law to protect irrevocable trust fund holders.",

    "text": "ASKS CHANGE IN LAW REGARDING BANK TRUST FUNDS\n\n Letters to the EditorTo the Editor of The Press: How many people who create irrevocable trusts for their dependents realize that the laws of Ohio permit the capital structure to be liquidated in the event of the bank failing? \"Impossible!\" says the average man. \"Trusts are a separate and distinct part of the bank and are treated quite differently.\"\n\nNevertheless, it is possible for a portion, and perhaps under certain circumstances the whole trust fund, to be treated as a commercial deposit and subjected to the same restrictions. During the bank chaos many people were suddenly confronted with this and it is time to come out in the open and make clear certain facts.\n\nLet us suppose an irrevocable trust fund is created which, of course, automatically gives full powers to the trust department to invest, sell, etc. This fund will usually be invested largely in government bonds, preferred stocks, and other legalized trust investments. Supposing any or all of the investments should be matured, the trust fund for an indefinite period at the discretion of the trust department, will be in whole or part liquid. Supposing during this period, the bank should suddenly cease payment or, as recently happened, restrict payments, what can happen under existing laws to the cash on hand? Is it held in the trust department for the trustor? It is not; the whole thing is thrown into the pot. Whatever the commercial depositor receives, who incidentally has the right to withdraw his money under normal circumstances at a moment's notice, the tied-hand-and-foot trustor will get the same. Just this has been done by banks recently and the rock-like security which the husband or father felt was in the trust department vanishes overnight.\n\nOne bank recently decided that trust fund balances on hand could not be honestly treated as a commercial deposit yet the lawyers shake their heads over the legality of their action. Honesty and sincerity of purpose of a bank in interpreting the word \"trust\" apparently means nothing. The law says you must fail in your trust and be virtually dishonest. Under the present law, in the final analysis, a bank which is desperate can legally liquidate an irrevocable trust fund and have it on deposit ready for general disposition in case of a run. The word \"trust\" has suddenly a new meaning and the existing laws are responsible. The need for change is obvious. ",

    "summary": "The author discusses their experience managing a small city cemetery and their dismissal, advocating for the economical use of organic matter to improve soil quality. They highlight their non-political appointment and the subsequent layoff on Dec. 1, 1932, as politically motivated, despite their expertise and adherence to civil service regulations. Furthermore, they express regret over the waste of organic material post-dismissal and the improper handling of tulip bulbs in the cemetery.",

    "text": "HOW PARKS ARE RUN\n\n To the Editor of The Press: R. Cass. Considering the timely and excellent letter written by Mr. Charles G. Irish, regarding the city parks, I am prompted to write a few words from my own experience.\n\nFor several years prior to Dec. 1, 1932, I had charge of a small city cemetery Alger. City cemeteries comprise a division of the Department of Parks and Public Property. When I took charge of this cemetery as it was the custom to rake up all leaves and loose organic matter each fall to be burnt. I started a system of storing the leaves in a pit, mixing in some good soil, sharp sand and, if possible, some commercial fertilizer or lime to aid in decomposition. Some of this material was later used wherever a summer mulch seemed advisable, and the balance was thoroughly worked into our top soil pile just prior to the succeeding autumn rake-up. By this means we increased materially our supply of friable, moisture-holding, reasonably rich top soil without much cost, as the labor of conserving this organic matter is surely not much greater than that required to destroy it.\n\nIn this cemetery there are a great many plantings of tulips and other spring flowering bulbs and as most of these are put in by lot-owners their locations are not always definitely known For this reason it was my custom to allow fallen leaves to remain on Bower beds and bare spots over winter. I never considered them more unsightly than the bare spots of earth which their removal would 'occasion.\n\nOn Dec. 1, in the interests of the Democratic organization and in deflance of the spirit of civil service regulations, I was laid off. This, in spite of the fact that I had no political backing when appointed, that I broke into cemetery work as a working, not nominal laborer, and that I was one of the few civil serv ice employees who was obliged to pass his examination before being put on a salary basis. This in no way affects an individual's ability to supervise the care of a cemetery or a park, my voting has been predominantly Democratic heretofore.\n\nImmediately after Dec. 1, I noticed the development of a spirited activity in the removal of the leaves which I had purposely allowed to remain on the cultivated spaces and I was sorry to see that instead of these being put on our pile they were thrown on the refuse dumps to be burned.\n\nJust yesterday I noticed where about two-thirds of the bulbs in a shallow planting of tulips had been heaved up and were lying on the surface of the ground because of the temperature, variations of our open winter.\n\nOf course the covering of loose leaves even carelessly spread would have helped to prevent this upheaval otherwise would probably have been a beautiful flower bed this spring.

In The Press of March 7, in the column written by the town's scavenger, Jack Raper, near the top he was commenting on the newspaper report that former President Hoover slept for 12 hours the first night that he was out of the White House, his comment was to the effect that Hoover slept for four years while he occupied the White House.\n\nI understand why attempts are made to assassinate presidents and why crazed men run amuck in Cleveland and kill innocent men and women.\n\nOn the front page of your paper you carried a Bible quotation and on your editorial page you run the comments of a man whose mind is always in the gutter, a man who makes his money by attacking public officials all the way from the president down.
