Now we will get some place. The new horse is no ordinary plug, it proves to be a lively, bucking bronco; such as any political stable ought to be proud of. No sooner than we hit the saddle, this bronco leaps into the air, snorting and stamping and out of the stream we go, in fact, so fast that we can hardly observe old timber passing, giant and decayed diplomatic oaks, old fumblers or money-changers, old hens setting on golden eggs, hatching poverty. Also calamity-howling demagogs who objected to any kind of a move. Yes, the new bronco is fast leaving them all behind. Oh, boy! but you are forced to hold fast to the new bronco to keep abreast. One is compelled to read three newspapers a day, besides tuning in on the radio, to get the new events, Why, the new horsey seems to know the way which we all want to go without guiding or pulling on the reins. It seems to me that it was our good fortune to have a horse in the middle of the stream to change to F. J. Turk 830 E. 185th street. ",

    "summary": "The letter's author, N. Bohar, argues for the necessity of a licensing bill in the Ohio Senate to regulate the barbering industry and ensure public health. Bohar claims that 85% of Ohio barbers support the bill, citing it as a means to prevent diseased barbers from working in the state, protect patrons' health, and maintain the integrity of the profession. The bill is presented as a well-established measure modeled after similar legislation in other states, yet Ohio lags behind in adopting such protective measures.",

    "text": "FAVORS LICENSE FOR BARBERS\n\n To the Editor of The Press: In your editorial of March 8 under the caption of \"Politicians Next,\" I read the article and it appears that you are opposing the barber bill in the Ohio Senate and I wonder if you are aware of the exact conditions of the barbering industry. Thirty-eight states in the Union have, found it necessary to license barbers to protect the health of the general public. This bill is patterned from the experience gained in the other states. The state of Ohio is completely surrounded by states having license bills and we find the barber who has been rejected in these various states coming into Ohio. Most of these men have been rejected because of diseases which prohibit them from working at the barbering profession in their home states. Eighty-fiv\u00e9 per cent of the barbers in the state of Ohio are in favor of the bill. The board created by the bill is self-sustaining from the license fee of the barber. It is no desire of the barbers to create a political football, but an honest desire to protect their business, the health of their patrons, and to assure the public that the men operating barber shops are barbers and operate a shop in the most sanitary method known. Under the bill, the board must consist of barbers and the barbers in Qhio had a similar bill before the Ohio Legislature for the past 30 years, and it is not a new idea even in Ohio, but Ohio is real backward on this subject.

I think every honest American blushes when he reads such \"bright sayings\" as Mr. Raper made in his column about former President Hoover. There are still 15,000,000 Americans who haven't forgotten how necessary Mr. Hoover was during the World War; how the same engineering ability that has been made so much light of during the last few years s\u00e5ved millions from starvation. Nor have we forgotten how the Democratic politicians took millions of dollars out of the taxpayers' pockets by not supporting Mr. Hoover in his efforts to produce governmental economies and measures to bring about the return of prosperity. We have not forgotten, either, that we were well on the road to prosperity last fall and would probably have avoided the suffering we are now enduring, if we would have voted for patriotic Americans instead of politicians. Because Mr. Hoover had foresight enough to see disaster as it approached and detoured us into safe highways, he receives no credit. If he would have allowed us to have been ship wrecked and then saved us, we would have called him a great hero. However, no truly great men have been honored while they lived; people chose Barabbas instead of Jesus Christ and so it i expecting too much from people to expect them to honor a man as honest, intelligent and self-sacrias Mr. Hoover.\n\nMrs. M.

Everyone knows that sleep is very beneficial both to the mental as well as to the physical side of nature. In fact it would be more ideally healing than anything our chemists could bottle for us, but only to those who can afford their medicine in such \"Lairdish\" manner, and to those who can swallow it. Velour drapes and dark rooms will undoubtedly induce slumber but only to the man who is in a condition to retire completely. Mental tension, the tight nerve-wrack-ing kind we find today, cannot be eased as simply as Dr. Laird would have us believe. According to the great psychologist, we must have thick rugs to deaden the noises, soothing hues of wall paper to quiet the nerves and heavy or dark shades to keep out the light.. Indeed! I can imagine a person worrying about rent and a stack of grocery bills, rushing out with his few last paltry dollars to buy these much-desired furnishings for the bedroom. Poor sap!\n\nJust one more thing, old dear. I am willing to wager that there are many soft beds in warm-shaded rooms whose inmates, too, turn worry and fret all night over tomorrow's meeting of board directors, and who are unaware and immune to the wondrous and healing effects of their delightful environment.

I believe there are 60,000 to 70,000 cradle phones used in Cleve-land, so that as much, as $15,000 or more a month paid out by our people is worth \"a little fuss.\"\n\nI might say that my efforts have not been confined to writing letters to your newspaper. I have done my best to present the impropriety of the continuance of the 25-cent charge directly to the State Utilities Commission. I have submitted data supporting my position. My recommendation would be that your correspondent above-mentioned present the facts which he has concerning the cost of bells, first investigating to make sure that his position as to the expense involved in original cost and maintenance is correct. Then if he will bear down with his information and contentions upon the State Utilities Commission, possibly he can get a hearing appointed on the charges to which he objects, as has been accomplished in reference to the cradle, telephone matter. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx the order to show cause why the company should not discontinue its charges for the cradle telephones, John F.
