This text is a letter to the editor as printed in a 1930s newspaper. Process the text according to the following rules. Return the results as JSON, with these fields: 'Author', 'Address', 'Subjects', 'Summary', and 'Names'. Follow these rules:

1. The first line of the text is the title.

2. The author's name is found at the end of the letter's text and is right-justified. It might be on a line by itself, or it might be appended to the last line of the letter.

3. The author's name might be followed by an address. It might be a street address with a number and a street name like "123 Main St.", or it might be a town name. If it is present it is on a line by itself, right-justified.

4. Create a brief summary of the main subject or argument of the letter.

5. The subjects should be selected exclusively from this list: "City Politics", "State Politics", "National Politics", "Economy", "World Events". Insert all that apply.

6. The Names field must contain an array of all of the names (real or hypothetical) mentioned in the text. Types of names include person, place, organization, office, and any others you need. It is very important not to miss any names, so if you are not sure, assume that you have found a name.

7. Be sure to include all place names: a city, a state, a country, etc. Format each name as a json object, with values for the text of the name, the type of name, and the identity. The identity contains any information you can provide about the likely identification of the name, given the historical context of the text. 

8. Include the place name "Cleveland" if the letter evidently deals with local affairs, and include "Ohio" if deals with state affairs. 

9. Do not invent or hallucinate any information: if you cannot identify a name, leave the identification empty.

10. Add a DocType field, with the string value "Letter".
